XSB web site documents at Sourceforge are in

    /home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/
    
on shell.sourceforge.net

The Web site is maintained in the XSB CVS repository.
To make changes to the Web site, you make changes to your local copy of the
Web site (in XSB/docs/homepage) and then check the changes in.

The directory /home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/shadow_site on shell.sourceforge.net
contains a checked out copy of the XSB web site. Once you checked your
changes to the Web site, run 

    cvs update

in /home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/shadow_site (new!) on
shell.sourceforge.net.  (TLS: you need the xsb password for this).
This should bring the shadow site up to date.  You can now check if
everything is OK on the shadow site by visiting

    http://xsb.sourceforge.net/shadow_site/

If things are fine, copy everything but the CVS/ subdirectory to
/home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs:

cp -fr *html *gif *jpg *php ..

/home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/ also has three manual subdirectories:

    	manual/  -- for PS and PDF versions of the manuals.
	manual1/ -- HTML version of Part I
	manual2/ -- HTML version of Part II

None of these are under cvs control. These directories should be prepared
locally and then copied using scp to

	shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/
