<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.6</h1></center>

<h3>General</h3>

Version 2.6 contains a number of changes, including new packages and
libraries for generation of manuals from code documentation and for
answer set programming.  Version 2.6 also allows a user-modifiable
extension for byte-code files, whose default .xwam extension replaces
the previous .O extension.  Existing features Version 2.6 have been
improved  in various ways, from better exception handling, to a more
robust Windows implementation, to numerous bug-fixes.

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li> Various aspects of XSB have been rewritten to support an
ISO-compatable error handling mechanism in which exceptional
conditions can be caught and handled by user programs.

<li> Fixed-depth indexing has been added for dynamic predicates.
Using fixed-depth indexing a term in a given arguments may be indexed
on the first five non-variable symbols.  Multiple-argument and
alternative indices also work with fixed-depth indexing just as they
do with outer functor indexing.

<li> Full-word integers are now supported in XSB via an implementation
of boxed integers.

<li> Date and time routines have been added as standard
predicates.

<li> The Chat engine has been removed so that the default SLG-WAM
engine is the only tabling engine available.

</ul>

<h3>Packages and Libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li> A new package, xsbdoc, has been added.  xsbdoc supports a
"literate programming" style, in which code-level comments can be used
to generate manuals.  It is based in part on Ciao system's lpdoc.

<li> The XASP package provides an efficient interface to SModels from
XSB.  It is a significant rewrite of the previous SModels interface.

<li> An ODBC interface to MySQL is now supported under Linux.  In
addition, Prolog terms can now be written to and read from database
strings.  

<li> A new library, stdscan.P is provided containing a configurable
scanner for text parsing.
<li> Updates to the major packages, including Flora-2 and XMC.

</ul>

<h3>Platform  stabilization </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Stability of XSB on Windows has been improved in many ways,
  both when XSB is compiled with Cygwin/GCC, and when compiled by
  native windows compilers.  These changes include a better
  configuration mechanism for Windows, a robust XSB-calling-C
  interface, and better support for gpp preprocessing of Prolog files.
  In addition, many standard and library predicates have been
  stabilized for Windows, including cputime/1, directry query
  routines, path and file handling, the format.P library, and others.

  <li> The build process has been fixed for 64-bit MIPS machine.  XSB
  should be stable on most 64-bit machines.

</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes and other improvements </h3>
<ul>
<li> Several bugfixes have been made for the CLP(R) package, including
expansion of math functions to include min/1, max/1, and pow/2.
</li>

<li> Hashing function have been changed to provide better indexing of
longish strings.
</li>

<li> Various bugs in pathname handling were fixed, and differences in
pathname handling between Unix and Windows were minimized.
</li>


</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li> The object files now have the (default) .xwam extension instead
of the .O extension.
</li>
<li>  The <tt>xsb_undefined_predicate_hook</tt> has been
  deprecated. Instead, XSB now throws the exception of the form
  <tt>error(undefined_predicate(Name,Arity,ModName),ErrorMessage)</tt>
  when an undefined predicate is called. This exception can be caught
  and appropriate action can be taken.
</li>


</ul>

<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.5</h1></center>

<h3>General</h3>

This is mostly a transitional release, where the major changes are the
move to use the SLGWAM engine as default, and the introduction of
garbage collection support for this engine. Also, several important
memory management related bugs have been fixed, increasing the
system's stability considerably.

<h3>Important Note</h3>

This is the last release to support the Chat engine. 

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li> SLGWAM stack management has been made the default rather than
Chat.  Chat is still available through a configuration option.
<li> A new heap garbage collector, called <tt> indirect </tt> has been
made the default garbage collector for SLGWAM.  In addition, the Chat
sliding and copying garbage collectors now also work on the SLGWAM
configuration. 
<li> New builtins round/2, ceil/2 and floor/2 for dealing with floating point
numbers added.
</ul>
<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Several memory management related bugs fixed.
  <li> Minor bug in Prolog debugger fixed.
  <li> Fixed problem with NULL values and ODBC
<li>
</ul>
<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li> None
</ul>
<h3>FLORA News</h3>
<p>
Flora-2 is still a late alpha release, but there have been
considerable improvements in stability and speed.
This release fixes many bugs, eliminates some restrictions, and adds
new features.
<ul>
<li> The most important new feature is the ability to check for undefined
predicates and methods in debug mode (see the manual regarding checking
undefinedness checks). This feature simplifies debugging considerably.
<li> Flora compiler now checks if a tabled predicate depends on an update
operation and issues appropriate warnings. Such dependency is considered to be
a likely program bug.
<li> Numbered anonymous oids added (e.g., _#123). They behave like regular
anonymous oids (_#) in the sense that they are substituted by a new oid.
However, numbered oids can be referenced within the same clause (e.g.,
_#12[self-&gt;_#12]).
<li> Optimized compilation of path expressions and nested terms.
</ul>

<hr>
<center>
<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.4</h1></center>

<h3>General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li> XSB now permits user programs to register hooks to be called when an
undefined predicate is encountered. This and other (previously undocumented)
hooks are described in the chapter titled <i>Hooks</i>
in Manual Part 1.
<li> The <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~lmc/">XMC Model
Checking System</a> is now included as a package in XSB.
<li> Local scheduling has been made the default scheduler.
<li> Uniform interface to various file operations (chdir, isdir, readable,
etc.) through the predicate <tt>path_sysop/2</tt> and
<tt>path_sysop/3</tt> (in module file_io). See Manual, Part 2 (<i>Script
Utilities</i>).
<li> New string matching function, <tt>string_match/4</tt>, which extends
<tt>str_sub/3</tt>. 
(<tt>string_match/4</tt> doesn't do pattern matching - use the
<tt>regmatch</tt> package for that). See Manual, Part 2, (<i>String
Manipulation</i>).
</ul>
<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>    Fixed subsumption bug prompted by certain uses of functors and
   lists.  The bug appeared as an inability to unify a (falsely
   identified) answer with an answer template.
</ul>
<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li> The meaning of argument 3 in predicate str_sub/3 has changed. It still
represents the position of the substring match. However, offsets now start from
0, like other string functions, instead of 1.
<li> A number of new predicates have been added as a step towards ISO compatability.  
</ul>
<h3>FLORA News</h3>
<p>
This release of XSB contains an alpha release of a
completely redesigned and reimplemented FLORA system (now called FLORA-2). Here
is an incomplete list of the main new features of the system:
<ul>
<li> Integrates F-logic, HiLog, and Transaction Logic into one coherent
language
<li> Provides a new, flexible module system
<li> Better equality maintenance and support for inheritance
<li> Support for preprocessing
<li> Many more enhancements
</ul>
<p>
We recommend that Flora users should start using Flora-2, as the previous
version of Flora is no longer maintained and will eventually be deprecated.

<hr>
<center>
<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.3</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>
A great number of bugs fixed, new features, performance
improvements.

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Subsumption:</b> In addition to variant-based tabling, XSB now
provides tabling based on subsumption of calls.    In such a 
"subsumption-based" tabled 
evaluation, answers from a more general subgoal are used to satisfy a
subsumed (more specific) subgoal, thereby permitting greater reuse of
computed results.  The tabling strategy may be chosen on a per
predicate basis.  Subsumption-based tabling typically yields better
performance in both time and space.  However, subsumptive tabling is
better suited to more declarative programs, as it may fail to give
proper results in the presence of certain Prolog constructs such as
var/1.  This implementation of subsumption-based tabling correctly
evaluates normal logic programs which do not require subgoal delays.
<li> <b>Jumptable Emulator:</b> The system is now able to take
advantage of special gcc features to implement a jumptable-based
emulator, which speeds up XSB considerably.
<li> <b>Sockets:</b> XSB now supports the socket select call and timeouts.
<li> <b>RDF parser:</b> The XSB libwww package that first appeared in
XSB 2.2 now has new interface to the RDF parser provided by e libwww
package from W3C.  It requires that the libwww library from W3C is
installed.
<li> An ISO-compatable <b>throw/catch mechanism</b>: It was already
present in version 2.2, but now it is also documented.
<li> Foreign C interface now works on SGI's IRIX.
<li> <b>Backtrackable assert and retract</b>, plus Perl-style
associative arrays. (Read about them in the section on modifying the
database in Manual 1.)
<li><b>Oracle Interface:</b> The Oracle interface has been brought
up-to-date with newer versions of Oracle.
<li><b>ODBC Interface:</b> The ODBC interface has been some major
cleanups, and several bugs have been fixed; it also now works with SQL
Server as well as Access. Support for multiple simultaneous
connections has been introduced.
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li> The type <tt>bool</tt> used by the external C interface has been renamed
to xsbBool, because of clashes with various include files that exist on some
platforms. Likewise, the macros for dealing with the variable string type used
by C programs that call XSB as a library have been renamed. For instance,
<tt>vstrDEFINE</tt> is now <tt>XSB_StrDefine</tt>. See Vol. 2 of the manual for
the new names.
<li> The predicates <tt>file_read_line</tt>, <tt>file_read_line_atom</tt>,
<tt>file_read_line_list</tt> have lost the last argument (the indicator of
whether the read has read the entire line). This argument is no longer
necessary, since buffers expand automatically to accommodate any size input.
</ul>

<center>
<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.2</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Support of Attributed Variables:</b> Attributed variables are now
supported in XSB (partially compatible with SICStus 3.8).  See <a
href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, Attributed
Variables.</a>
<li><b>Random Number Generator:</b> A builtin random number generator is
implemented, and a set of predicates, which are compatible with SICStus
3.8, are provided.
</ul>


<h3>New Packages</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    <b><tt>libwww</tt></b> - a powerful Web access package.
    See <a href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, The Libwww
    Package.</a>
    This package has been tested only on Solaris 2.6 and Linux 2.2.
    It definitely needs configuration work in order to run under Windows.
    <br>
    This XSB package relies on the W3C's libwww library and requires it to
    be installed. The entire package is implemented in C and is much faster
    than other related Internet access packages for Prolog, e.g., PiLLOW). The
    package provides the following functionality: 
    <ul>
    <li> HTML parser.
    <li> (Non-validating) XML parser (including handling of external entities).
    <li> The ability to simultaneously dispatch several HTTP requests and parse
         the responses as they arrive; no waiting until the entire
	 document is received.
    <li> Fetching web pages and filling out forms.
    <li> Header information.
    <li> Timeouts.
    <li> Basic and digest  authentication. SSL to follow.
    <li> Redirection.
    <li> Error handling.
    </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    The C calls <tt>xsb_query_string_string</tt> and <tt>xsb_next_string</tt>
    that interface C programs to XSB now use the new <tt>VarString</tt> data
    type instead of <tt>char*</tt>. 
    It is no longer necessary to pass the size of the buffer to these
    functions. See XSB Manual, Volume 2, to learn more about the
    variable-length string data type.
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Crashing of XSB-ODBC interface under Windows;
<li>Memory violations of some internal operations on delay lists.
</ul>

<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.1</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>
<b>Process management API:</b> XSB can now spawn subprocesses and capture their
standard I/O into XSB streams. This allows XSB to communicate with other
processes. See <a href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, Communication
with Subprocesses.</a>

<p>
<b>XSB preprocessor:</b> There is now a compiler option, <tt>xpp_on</tt>, which
tells the XSB compiler to put the source through a preprocessor. The default is
<a href="http://www.math.polytechnique.fr/cmat/auroux/prog/gpp.html">gpp</a>, a
powerful preprocessor that understands both C and Prolog syntax.

<p>
<b>High-level C interface:</b> XSB can now automatically generate wrappers for
the most common C functions. Such functions can now be simply declared using
compiler directives and then be called from XSB.

<p>
<B>Enhancements to the sockets interface:</B>
New calls such as <tt>socket_set_option, socket_select,</tt>, etc.
Certain socket calls and file I/O calls can be timed-out.

<p>
<b>I/O enhancements:</b>
There are several additions to the low-level I/O library, such as
<tt>file_clone, file_reopen, pipe_open</tt>.
Certain socket calls and file I/O calls can be timed-out.

<p>
<b>New section on string manipulation in manual part 2:</b>
Some of the predicates described there are old (but weren't documented) and
some are new.

<p>
<b>Call changes:</b>
New calls: number_digits/2, number_codes/2, atom_codes/2 replace atom_chars/2
and number_chars/2.

<p>
<b>Atom length:</b>
Atom length in compiled code is no longer limited to 255.
The 255 limit on the size of ldoptions directive in the Foreign C interface
has been removed as well.

<p>
<b>Debugger enhancements:</b>
Many additional options: profiling, verbose skip, extensive trace control
facility.

<h3>New Packages</h3>

<p>
<b>sModels</b>: Implements stable model semantics.

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> 
   <b>Binary incompatibility!!!</b>
   The format of the XSB .O files has been changed. Make sure you recompile
   all your programs! (The binaries that come with the XSB distribution have
   the new format.)
<li>
  <tt>unix/1</tt> is now called <tt>shell/1</tt>. It exists in module
  <tt>shell</tt>, and is imported from there automatically.
<li>
  The standard predicates
  atom_chars/2 and number_codes/2 now behave as in the Prolog standard (return
  lists of atoms rather than ASCII codes).
  The old behavior is provided by the standard predicates atom_codes/2 and
  number_codes/2.
<li>
  A number of backward-incompatible changes in socket calls.
  First, the predicates socket_send_eof/1 and socket_send_asci/2 have been
  removed. This functionality is available through other calls.
  <p>
  Second, all socket predicates now have an extra argument, the error code.
  The old-style predicates have been preserved, but their behavior isn't
  guaranteed to be 100% the same. The fileptr argument in socket_connect call
  has been deleted. The fileptr argument in socket_accept no longer denotes an
  XSB I/O port. Instead, it denoted a socket descriptor. It can be converted to
  an I/O port using the new builtin fd2ioport.
  <p>
  socket_send/3 no longer appends the message delimited (the backquote).
  Programs that rely on this feature will not work any longer.
  Instead of this old hack, socket_send now prepends a 4-byte header that
  specifies the length of the message body. The primitive socket_recv/3 uses it
  to determine the length of the message it received.
</ul>

<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.0</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>
<p>
<font size=+0>XSB Version 2.0 offers a more flexible handling of dynamic code.
XSB now also includes a number of preprocessors that allow it to
efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic, Annotated logic, and
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.  Finally, XSB 2.0 provides
various packages for regular expression and wildcard matching.

<p>&nbsp;Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially&nbsp;
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses.&nbsp; The result
is a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>
Added support for <a href="http://www.declarativa.com/interprolog">InterProlog</a>,
a Java front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>


<h3> Packages</h3>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the following packages:
<ul>
<li>
 <i>FLORA</i>: A full-fledged F-logic to XSB compiler and shell.
<li> <i>GAP</i>: support for annotated logic programming.
<li> <i>SLX</i>: allows XSB to evaluate extended logic programs according to
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
<li> <i>PARLMATCH</i>: an interface to Perl pattern matching and
string substitution capabilities.
<li> <i>REGMATCH</i>: provides similar functionality,
but relies on a POSIX-compliant C library instead of Perl.
<li> <i>WILDMATCH</i>: allows matching wildcards and globbing of directories.
Relies on a POSIX 2 compliant C library.
</ul>

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
The following incompatible changes have been made in XSB Version 2.0:
<ul>
<li>
    The file .xsbrc in the home directory is no longer used. Instead, XSB
    now uses the directory .xsb/ and the startup file is .xsb/xsbrc
    It is now possible to have pretty much any Prolog code in that file.
<li>
    There is a change in how the library_directory predicate is used.
    The user must now assert directories into this predicate.
    There is no need to export this predicate (this predicate is now
    global).
<li>
    XSB is no longer supported on MS DOS.
<li>
    In order to be consistent with the ISO Prolog standard, XSB no
    longer supports mixing compiled and dynamic code for the same
    predicate. 
<li> 
    The predicate is_string/1, which used to check if its argument is a list of
    characters, is now replaced by the builtin is_charlist/1. There is now also
    is_charlist/2 (see the manual).
</ul>
