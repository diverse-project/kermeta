    <h1>How to Use XSB DLL from Visual Basic</h1>

To use the XSB DLL (compiled with the standard calling conventions)
from Visual Basic, the following VB declarations should be included:

<PRE>
Option Explicit
'declarations
Private Declare Function XSB_INIT_STRING Lib "xsbdll" Alias
"_xsb_init_string@4" (ByVal opts As String) As Long
Private Declare Function XSB_COMMAND_STRING Lib "xsbdll" Alias
"_xsb_command_string@4" (ByVal cmd As String) As Long
Private Declare Function XSB_QUERY_STRING_STRING Lib "xsbdll" Alias
"_xsb_query_string_string@16" (ByVal query As String, ByVal buff As String,
ByVal blen As Long, ByVal sep As String) As Long
Private Declare Function XSB_NEXT_STRING Lib "xsbdll" Alias
"_xsb_next_string@12" (ByVal buff As String, ByVal blen As Long, ByVal sep
As String) As Long
Private Declare Function XSB_CLOSE_QUERY Lib "xsbdll" Alias
"_xsb_close_query@0" () As Long
Private Declare Function XSB_CLOSE Lib "xsbdll" Alias "_xsb_close@0" () As
Long
</PRE>

The following VB functions were found useful by one user to provide a
little more support in the XSB interface:

'Started used to close XSB queries when within wrappers functions when
'query answers remain on stack
