\chapter{Constraint Handling Rules} \label{chr}
%=============================================

\section{Introduction}
%=====================

Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a committed-choice bottom-up
language embedded in XSB. It is designed for writing constraint
solvers and is particularily useful for providing application-specific
constraints.  It has been used in many kinds of applications, like
scheduling, model checking, abduction, type checking among many
others.

CHR has previously been implemented in other Prolog systems (SICStus,
Eclipse, Yap, hProlog), Haskell and Java. The XSB CHR system is based on
the hProlog CHR system.

In this documentation we restrict ourselves to giving a short overview
of CHR in general and mainly focus on XSB-specific elements.  For a
more thorough review of CHR we refer the reader to
\cite{chr_survey}. More background on CHR can be found at
\cite{chr_site}.

In Section \ref{SyntaxAndSemantics} we present the syntax of CHR in XSB and
explain informally its operational semantics. Next, Section \ref{practical}
deals with practical issues of writing and compiling XSB programs containing
CHR. Section \ref{predicates} provides a few useful predicates to inspect
the constraint store and Section \ref{examples} illustrates CHR with two
example programs. How to combine CHR with tabled predicates is covered in
Section \ref{TCHR}. Finally, Section \ref{guidelines} concludes with a few
practical guidelines for using CHR.


\section{Syntax and Semantics} \label{SyntaxAndSemantics}
%=============================

\subsection{Syntax}
%-----------------

The syntax of CHR rules in XSB is the following:

\begin{verbatim}
rules --> rule, rules.
rules --> [].

rule --> name, actual_rule, pragma, [atom('.')].

name --> xsb_atom, [atom('@')].
name --> [].

actual_rule --> simplification_rule.
actual_rule --> propagation_rule.
actual_rule --> simpagation_rule.

simplification_rule --> constraints, [atom('<=>')], guard, body.
propagation_rule --> constraints, [atom('==>')], guard, body.
simpagation_rule --> constraints, [atom('\')], constraints, [atom('<=>')], 
                     guard, body.

constraints --> constraint, constraint_id.
constraints --> constraint, [atom(',')], constraints.

constraint --> xsb_compound_term.

constraint_id --> [].
constraint_id --> [atom('#')], xsb_variable.

guard --> [].
guard --> xsb_goal, [atom('|')].

body --> xsb_goal.

pragma --> [].
pragma --> [atom('pragma')], actual_pragmas.

actual_pragmas --> actual_pragma.
actual_pragmas --> actual_pragma, [atom(',')], actual_pragmas.

actual_pragma --> [atom('passive(')], xsb_variable, [atom(')')].

\end{verbatim}

Additional syntax-related terminology:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{head:} the constraints in an \texttt{actual\_rule} before
                     the arrow (either \texttt{<=>} or \texttt{==>})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantics}
%--------------------

In this subsection the operational semantics of CHR in XSB are presented
informally. They do not differ essentially from other CHR systems.

When a constraint is called, it is considered an active constraint and
the system will try to apply the rules to it. Rules are tried and executed
sequentially in the order they are written. 

A rule is conceptually tried for an active constraint in the following
way. The active constraint is matched with a constraint in the head of the
rule. If more constraints appear in the head they are looked for among the
suspended constraints, which are called passive constraints in this context. If
the necessary passive constraints can be found and all match with the head of
the rule and the gaurd of the rule succeeds, then the rule is committed and
the body of the rule executed.  If not all the necessary passive constraint
can be found, the matching fails or the guard fails, then the body is not
executed and the process of trying and executing simply continues with 
the following rules. If for
a rule, there are multiple constraints in the head, the active constraint
will try the rule sequentially multiple times, each time trying to match with
another constraint.

This process ends either when the active constraint disappears, i.e. it is
removed by some rule, or after the last rule has been processed. In the latter
case the active constraint becomes suspended.

A suspended constraint is eligible as a passive constraint for an active
constraint. The other way it may interact again with the rules, is when
a variable appearing in the constraint becomes bound to either a nonvariable
or another variable involved in one or more constraints. In that case the
constraint is triggered, i.e. it becomes an active constraint and all the rules
are tried.

\paragraph{Rule Types}
%- - - - - - - - - - 
There are three different kinds of rules, each with their specific semantics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{simplification:}

The simplification rule removes the constraints in its head and calls its body.

\item \texttt{propagation:}

The propagation rule calls its body exactly once for the constraints in its head.

\item \texttt{simpagation:}

The simpagation rule removes the constraints in its head after the $\backslash$ and then calls its body.
It is an optimization of simplification rules of the form:
\[constraints_1, constraints_2 <=> constraints_1, body \]
Namely, in the simpagation form:
\[ constraints_1 \backslash constraints_2 <=> body \]
The $constraints_1$ constraints are not called in the body.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rule Names}
%- - - - - - - - - - 
Naming a rule is optional and has no semantical meaning. It only functions
as documentation for the programmer.

\paragraph{Pragmas}
%- - - - - - - - -
The semantics of the pragmas are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{passive/1:} the constraint in the head of a rule with the identifier specified by
                          the \textbf{passive/1} pragma can only act as a passive constraint in that rule.
\end{itemize}
Additional pragmas may be released in the future.

\section{CHR in XSB Programs} \label{practical}
%===========================

\subsection{Embedding in XSB Programs}

Since chr is an XSB package, it must be explicitly loaded before being
used.
\begin{verbatim}
?- [chr].
\end{verbatim}

CHR rules are written in a {tt .chr} file. They should be preceded by
a declaration of the constraints used: 
\begin{verbatim}
:- constraints ConstraintSpec1, ConstraintSpec2, ...
\end{verbatim}
where each \texttt{ConstraintSpec} is a functor description of the form name$\slash$arity pair. Ordinary code
may be freely written between the CHR rules.

The CHR constraints defined in a particulary .chr file are associated
with a CHR module. The CHR module name can be any atom. The default module is
\texttt{user}. A different module name can be declared as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
:- chr_module(modulename).
\end{verbatim}
One should never load different files with the same CHR module name.


\subsection{Compilation}

Files containing CHR rules are required to have a {\tt .chr}
extension, and their compilation has two steps.  First the {\tt .chr}
file is preprocessed into a {\tt .P} file containing XSB code.  This
\texttt{.P} file can then be loaded in the XSB emulator and used
normally.

\begin{description}
\ournewitem{load\_chr(File)} {chr\_pp}\index{\texttt{load\_chr/1}}
%
{\tt load\_chr/1} takes as input a file name whose extension is either
{\tt .chr} or that has no extension.  It preprocesses {\tt File} if
the times of the CHR rule file is newer than that of the corresponding
Prolog file, and then consults the Prolog file.

\ournewitem{preprocess(File,PFile)} {chr\_pp}\index{\texttt{preprocess/2}}
%
{\tt preprocess/2} takes as input a file name whose extension is
either {\tt .chr} or that has no extension.  It preprocesses {\tt
File} if the times of the CHR rule file is newer than that of the
corresponding Prolog file, but does not consult the Prolog file.

\end{description}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\comment{

For this purpose the \texttt{bin} directory of the XSB installation contains
the \texttt{chr\_pp} script. The example below shows how to run it on a
\texttt{.chr} file to create the corresponding \texttt{.P} file.

\begin{verbatim}
$ chr_pp leq.chr
[xsb_configuration loaded]
[sysinitrc loaded]
[packaging loaded]

XSB Version 2.6-b1 (Verboden Vrucht) of October 2, 2003
[i686-pc-linux-gnu; mode: optimal; engine: slg-wam; gc: indirection; scheduling: local]

| ?- [chr_pp loaded]

yes
| ?- start of CHR compilation

end of CHR compilation

yes
| ?-
End XSB (cputime 0.03 secs, elapsetime 0.05 secs)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Note}

When compiling a \texttt{.P} file generated by the preprocessor, many singleton
warnings may be issued.
}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Useful Predicates} \label{predicates}
%=========================

The \texttt{chr} module contains several useful predicates that allow
inspecting and printing the content of the constraint store.

\begin{description}
\ournewitem{show\_store(+Mod)}{chr}\index{\texttt{show\_store/1}}
  Prints all suspended constraints of module \texttt{Mod} to
  the standard output.
\ournewitem{suspended\_chr\_constraints(+Mod,-List)}{chr}\index{\texttt{suspended\_constraints/2}}
  Returns the list of all suspended CHR constraints of the given module.
\end{description}

\section{Examples} \label{examples}
%================

Here are two example constraint solvers written in CHR.

\begin{itemize}

\item
The program below defines a solver with one constraint, 
\texttt{leq/2}, which is a less-than-or-equal constraint.

\begin{verbatim}
:- chr_module(leq).

:- export cycle/3.

:- import length/2 from basics.

:- constraints leq/2.
reflexivity  @ leq(X,X) <=> true.
antisymmetry @ leq(X,Y), leq(Y,X) <=> X = Y.
idempotence  @ leq(X,Y) \ leq(X,Y) <=> true.
transitivity @ leq(X,Y), leq(Y,Z) ==> leq(X,Z).

cycle(X,Y,Z):-
        leq(X,Y),
        leq(Y,Z),
        leq(Z,X).
\end{verbatim}

\item
The program below implements a simple finite domain
constraint solver.

\begin{verbatim}
:- chr_module(dom).

:- import member/2 from basics.

:- constraints dom/2. 

dom(X,[]) <=> fail.
dom(X,[Y]) <=> X = Y.
dom(X,L1), dom(X,L2) <=> intersection(L1,L2,L3), dom(X,L3).

intersection([],_,[]).
intersection([H|T],L2,[H|L3]) :-
        member(H,L2), !,
        intersection(T,L2,L3).
intersection([_|T],L2,L3) :-
        intersection(T,L2,L3).
\end{verbatim}
		
\end{itemize}

These and more examples can be found in the \texttt{examples/chr/} folder accompanying
this XSB release.

\section{CHR and Tabling} \label{TCHR}
%=======================

The advantage of CHR in XSB over other Prolog systems, is that CHR can be
combined with tabling. Hence part of the constraint solving can be performed
once and reused many times. This has already shown to be useful for applications
of model checking with constraints.

However the use of CHR constraints is slightly more complicated for tabled
predicates.  This section covers how exactly to write a tabled
predicate that has one or more arguments that also appear as arguments in
suspended constraints. In the current release the CHR-related parts of the
tabled predicates have to be written by hand. In a future release this may
be substituted by an automatic transformation.

\subsection{General Issues and Principles}
%----------------------------------------

The general issue is how call constraints should be passed in to the tabled
predicate and how answer constraints are passed out of the predicate. Additionally,
in some cases care has to be taken not to generate infinite programs.

The recommended approach is to write the desired tabled predicate as if
no additional code is required to integrate it with CHR.  Next transform
the tabled predicate to take into account the combination of tabling and
CHR. Currently this transformation step has to be done by hand. In the future
we hope to replace this hand coding with programmer declarations that guide
automated transformations.

Hence we depart from an ordinary tabled predicate, say \texttt{p/1}:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
:- table p/1.

p(X) :- 
   ... /* original body of p/1 */.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

In the following we will present several transformations or extensions of
this code to achieve a particular behavior. At least the transformation
discussed in subsection \ref{abstraction} should be applied to obtain a
working integration of CHR and tabling. Further extensions are optional.

\subsection{Call Abstraction} \label{abstraction}
%---------------------------

Currently only one type of call abstraction is supported: full constraint
abstraction, i.e. all constraints on variables in the call should be
removed. The technique to accomplish this is to replace all variables in
the call that have constraints on them with fresh variables. After the call,
the original variables should be unified with the new ones.

In addition, the call environment constraint store should be replaced with an
empty constraint store before the call and on return the answer store should be merged
back into the call environment constraint store.

The previously mentioned tabled predicate \texttt{p/1} should be transformed
 to:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
:- import merge_answer_store/1, 
          get_chr_store/1,
          set_chr_store/1,
          get_chr_answer_store/2
   from chr.

:- table tabled_p/2.

p(X) :-
        tabled_p(X1,AnswerStore),
        merge_answer_store(AnswerStore),
        X1 = X.

tabled_p(X,AnswerStore) :-
        get_chr_store(CallStore),
        set_chr_store(_EmptyStore)
        orig_p(X),
        get_chr_answer_store(chrmod,AnswerStore),
        set_chr_store(CallStore).

orig_p(X) :-
   ... /* original body of p/1 */.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

This example shows how to table the CHR constraints of a single CHR module
\texttt{chrmod}. If multiple CHR modules are involved, one should add similar
arguments for the other modules.

\subsection{Answer Projection}
%----------------------------

To get rid of irrelevant constraints, most notably on local variables, the answer
constraint store should in some cases be projected on the variables in the call.
This is particularly important for programs where otherwise an infinite number 
of answers with ever growing answer constraint stores could be generated.

The current technique of projection is to provide an additional \texttt{project/1}
constraint to the CHR solver definition. The argument of this constraint is
the list of variables to project on. Appropriate CHR rules should be written
to describe the interaction of this \texttt{project/1} constraint with other
constraints in the store. An additional rule should take care of removing
the \texttt{project/1} constraint after all such interaction.

The \texttt{project/1} constraint should be posed before returning from the tabled
predicate.

If this approach is not satisfactory or powerful enough to implement the
desired projection operation, you should resort to manipulating the underlying
constraint store representation. Contact the maintainer of XSB's CHR system
for assistance.

\paragraph{Example}
%- - - - - - - - -
Take for example a predicate \texttt{p/1} with a less than or equal constraint
\texttt{leq/2} on variables and integers. The predicate \texttt{p/1} has local
variables, but when \texttt{p} returns we are not interested in any constraints
involving local variables. Hence we project on the argument of \texttt{p/1}
with a project constraint as follows:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
:- import memberchk/2 from lists.

:- import merge_answer_store/1, 
          get_chr_store/1,
          set_chr_store/1,
          get_chr_answer_store/2
   from chr.

:- table tabled_p/2.

:- constraints leq/2, project/1.

... /* other CHR rules */
project(L) \ leq(X,Y) <=>
        ( var(X), \+ memberchk(X,L) 
        ; var(Y), \+ memberchk(Y,L)
        ) | true.
       
project(_) <=> true. 
        
p(X) :-
        tabled_p(X1,AnswerStore),
        merge_answer_store(AnswerStore),
        X1 = X.

tabled_p(X,AnswerStore) :-
        get_chr_store(CallStore),
        set_chr_store(_EmptyStore)
        orig_p(X),
        project([X]),
        get_chr_answer_store(chrmod,AnswerStore),
        set_chr_store(CallStore).
        
orig_p(X) :-
   ... /* original body of p/1 */.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The example in the following subsection shows projection in a full application.

\subsection{Answer Combination}
%-----------------------------

Sometimes it is desirable to combine different answers to a tabled predicate
into one single answer or a subset of answers. Especially when otherwise
there would be an infinite number of answers. If the answers are expressed as
constraints on some arguments and the logic of combining is encoded as CHR
rules, answers can be combined by merging the respective answer constraint
stores.

Another case where this is useful is when optimization is desired. If the
answer to a predicate represents a valid solution, but an optimal solution
is desired, the answer should be represented as constraints on arguments.
By combining the answer constraints, only the most constrained, or optimal,
answer is kept.

\paragraph{Example} 
%- - - - - - - - -
An example of a program that combines answers for
both termination and optimisation is the shortest path program below:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
:- chr_module(path).

:- import length/2 from lists.

:- import merge_chr_answer_store/1, 
          get_chr_store/1,
          set_chr_store/1,
          get_chr_answer_store/2
   from chr.

breg_retskel(A,B,C,D) :- '_$builtin'(154).

:- constraints geq/2, plus/3, project/1.

geq(X,N) \ geq(X,M) <=> number(N), number(M), N =< M | true.

reflexivity  @ geq(X,X) <=> true.
antisymmetry @ geq(X,Y), geq(Y,X) <=> X = Y.
idempotence  @ geq(X,Y) \ geq(X,Y) <=> true.
transitivity @ geq(X,Y), geq(Y,Z) ==> var(Y) | geq(X,Z).

plus(A,B,C) <=> number(A), number(B) | C is A + B.
plus(A,B,C), geq(A,A1) ==> plus(A1,B,C1), geq(C,C1).
plus(A,B,C), geq(B,B1) ==> plus(A,B1,C1), geq(C,C1).

project(X) \ plus(_,_,_) # ID <=> true pragma passive(ID).
project(X) \ geq(Y,Z) # ID <=> (Y \== X ; var(Z) )| true pragma passive(ID).
project(_) <=> true.

path(X,Y,C) :-
	tabled_path(X,Y,C1,AS),
	merge_chr_answer_store(AS),
	C = C1.
	
:- table tabled_path/4.

tabled_path(X,Y,C,AS) :-
	'_$savecp'(Breg),
	breg_retskel(Breg,4,Skel,Cs),
	copy_term(p(X,Y,C,AS,Skel),p(OldX,OldY,OldC,OldAS,OldSkel)),
        get_chr_store(GS),
	set_chr_store(_GS1),
	orig_path(X,Y,C),
        project(C),
	( get_returns(Cs,OldSkel,Leaf),
	  OldX == X, OldY == Y ->
            merge_chr_answer_store(OldAS),
            C = OldC,
            get_chr_answer_store(path,MergedAS),
            sort(MergedAS,AS),
            ( AS = OldAs ->
                fail
            ;
                delete_return(Cs,Leaf)
            )
	;
            get_chr_answer_store(path,UnsortedAS),
            sort(UnsortedAS,AS)
	),
        set_chr_store(GS).

orig_path(X,Y,C) :- edge(X,Y,C1), geq(C,C1).
orig_path(X,Y,C) :- path(X,Z,C2), edge(Z,Y,C1), plus(C1,C2,C0), geq(C,C0).

edge(a,b,1).
edge(b,a,1).
edge(b,c,1).
edge(a,c,3).
edge(c,a,1).
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The predicate \texttt{orig\_path/3} specifies a possible path between two
nodes in a graph. In \texttt{tabled\_path/4} multiple possible paths are
combined together into a single path with the shortest distance.  Hence the
tabling of the predicate will reject new answers that have a worse distance
and will replace the old answer when a better answer is found. The final
answer gives the optimal solution, the shortest path. It is also necessary
for termination to keep only the best answer. When cycles appear in the graph,
 paths with longer and longer distance could otherwise be put in the table,
contributing to the generation of even longer paths. Failing for worse answers avoids
this infinite build-up.

The predicate also includes a projection to remove constraints on local variables 
and only retain the bounds on the distance.

The sorting canonicalizes the answer stores, so that they can be compared.

\subsection{Overview of Tabling-related Predicates}
%-------------------------------------------------
\begin{description}
\ournewitem{merge\_answer\_store(+AnswerStore)}{chr}\index{\texttt{merge\_answer\_store/1}}
  Merges the given CHR answer store into the current global CHR constraint store.
\ournewitem{get\_chr\_store(-ConstraintStore)}{chr}\index{\texttt{get\_chr\_store/1}}

  in the specified CHR module, in the format of an answer store
  usable as a return argument of a tabled predicate.
\end{description}

\section{Guidelines} \label{guidelines}
%==================

In this section we cover several guidelines on how to use CHR to write constraint solvers
and how to do so efficiently.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Set semantics:}
      The CHR system allows the presence of identical constraints, i.e. multiple constraints
      with the same functor, arity and arguments. For most constraint solvers, this is not
      desirable: it affects efficiency and possibly termination. Hence appropriate simpagation
      rules should be added of the form:
      \[ constraint \backslash constraint <=> true \]
\item \textbf{Multi-headed rules:}
      Multi-headed rules are executed more efficiently when the constraints share one or more variables.
\end{itemize}

\section{CHRd}

An alternate implementation of CHR can be found in the CHRd package.
The main objective of the CHRd package is to optimize processing of
constraints in the environment where termination is guaranteed by the
tabling engine, (and where termination benefits provided by the
existing solver are not critical).  CHRd takes advantage of XSB's
tabling to simplify CHR's underlying storage structures and solvers.
Specifically, we entirely eliminate the thread-global constraint store
in favor of a distributed one, realized as a collection of sets of
constraints entirely associated with program variables.  This decision
limits the applicability of CHRd to a restricted class of CHR
programs, refered to as direct-indexed CHR,in which all constraints in
the head of a rule are connected by shared variables.  Most CHR
programs are direct-indexed, and other programs may be easily
converted to fall into this class. Another advance of CHRd is its
set-based semantics which removes the need to maintain the propagation
history, thus allowing further simplicity in the representation of the
constraints.  The CHRd package itself is described in \cite{SaSr06a},
and both the semantics of CHRd and the class of direct-indexed CHR are
formally defined in \cite{SaSR06b}.
