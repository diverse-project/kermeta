<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Version 3.0 (Sagres) </h2>

<h3>General</h3>
<p> Version 3.0 is a major rewriting of the XSB engine to support
multi-threading and to include many new and improved features.
</p>

<h3>Major New Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The XSB engine has been entirely rewritten to allow a user to
  create and run multiple XSB threads within a single process on both
  Unix and Windows.  Thread manipulation is based on the semantics of
  Posix threads, and includes major Posix-style operations such as
  detaching, joining, and canceling threads.  The engine has been
  designed to allow hundreds of threads to execute concurrently,
  including asserting and retracting dynamic code, creating and
  abolishing tables, and performing I/O.  To support this, dynamic
  predicates and tables are considered to be thread-private by
  default, but may also be declared to be shared among threads when
  appropriate.

  <li> Improved garbage collection routines have been written to
  reclaim space for dynamic clauses, SLG tables, and Prolog atoms.
  Garbage collection for thread-private dynamic clauses and tables,
  can occur concurrently in multiple threads.

  <li> XSB now supports 32-bit integer and 64-bit float computation by
  default.

  <li> A new package, CHRd has been added.  CHRd is an alternative
    implementation of Constraint Handling Rules, which uses a
    distributed storage of constraints and a set-based operational
    semantics.  The distributed storage of constraints can lead to
    efficiencies when tabling predicates within a CHR framework.
</ul>

<h3>Other Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A number of changes have been made to make XSB more compatible
  with the ISO standard for Prolog.  Changes have been made to XSB's
  scanning of atoms and numbers, exception handling, and to handling
  of undefined predicates.  In addition, Version 3.0 includes the new
  ISO
  predicates <tt>unify_with_occurs_check/2</tt>, <tt>atom_length/2</tt>
  and <tt>initialization/1</tt> .

  <li> The compiler now generates more efficient code for
  deterministic tests within conditionals.

  <li> Several changes have been made to support (non ISO)
  compatibility with other Prologs.  
    <ul>
       <li> XSB's compiler and consult mechanism now recognizes files
  with a <tt>.pl</tt> extension as well as a <tt>.P</tt> extension.  

       <li> Clauses for dynamic predicates can now be included in
       statically compiled files.

       <li> <tt>min/1</tt> and <tt>max/1</tt> are now included as arithmetic
  functions.
    </ul>

  <li> The following predicates provide new functionity beyond that
  discussed.
    <ul> 
      <li> <tt>term_to_atom/3</tt> allows an atom to be created from a term
	using the write options familiar from <tt>write_term/3</tt>.
    
      <li> <tt>statistics</tt> provides a much more detailed
	account of how program memory is used.

      <li> New predicates, <tt>abolish_module_tables/1</tt>,
	<tt>abolish_private_tables/0</tt>,
	and <tt>abolish_shared_tables/0</tt> allow greater flexibility
	for invalidating tables for sets of predicates.
    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>







<h2>Version 2.7.1 (Kinryo) </h2>
<p>
Version 2.7.1 is a minor release whose main changes are to support the
tagging required by newer versions of Linux, as well as to support
foreign language calls and packages on the Apple Macintosh.  Other bug
fixes and functionality improvements have also been made.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A new tagging scheme has been created to handle tagging on newer
  versions of Linux.  The choice of tagging is made automatically by
  XSB's configuration mechanism.
  </li>
  <li> The XSB/C foreign language interface is now supported under
  Macintosh OS X.  In addition, fixes have been made to perlmatch
  regmatch, and wildmatch to support these packages on OS X.  These
  patches were submitted by Barry Evans.
  </li>
  <li> ODBC Package: Added odbc_sql_cnt/4 predicate to be used to call
  an Update, insert, or delete SQL statement.  It returns the
  number of affected rows in the fourth parameter of the call.  Also
  added support for use of iodbc (www.iodbc.org) driver manager.
  </li>
  <li> Fixed bug in setof in handling variables in template and
  patterns.  The fix was submitted by Bart Demoen and Kostis
  Sagonas.
  </li>
  <li> .cpp files can now be compiled, loaded and called from XSB.
  </li>
  <li> Changed write_canonical to write more complete floating point numbers.
  </li>
  <li>New packages sgml and xpath have been added. The sgml package can parse
  XML, HTML, and even SGML; it is adapted from SWI Prolog.
  The xpath package supports XPath queries to XML documents.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.7 (Kinryo) </h2>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Version 2.7 has many fixes to bugs and improvements to packages and
libraries.
</p>

<h3>Major New Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Constraint Handling Rules</b> package includes both a
  CHR runtime system and a compiler to convert CHR files to
  Prolog files.  This packages allow CHR to be used with tabling, and
  includes several sample CHR solvers that have been ported to XSB.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>ISO-style streams</b> are now supported by all XSB file I/O.
  Streams can be used to access strings and pipes as well as files,
  and the distinction between I/O streams and I/O ports has been
  removed.  New I/O and other predicates to support ISO functionality
  have also been added.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <b>dbdrivers</b> package provides functionality to manage multiple
	drivers and databases from XSB,  and currently supports ODBC
	and mysql drivers.
  </li>
  <li>
  XSB now has the capability to determine the proportion of
  time spent in each predicate and module via the <b>XSB Profiling
  library.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
  XSB now prints out the forward and backward execution stacks
  upon unhandled errors, allowing for better debugging.  This facility
  is on by default, but can be turned off using an XSB flag.
  </li>
  <li>
  A new faculty <b>xsb_lint</b> has been created to
  help determine which predicates must be exported and imported into
  files upon modularization. Through the statements
  document_export/1 and document_import/1, Version 2.7 also
  supports "pseudo-modules".  Such files act as are regular files in
  terms of execution, but their declarations are used by
  xsb_lint, xsbdoc and the compiler's use inference pass.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Functionality for use inference, a part of XSB's compiler has
  been expanded.  Use inference now checks standard meta-predicates
  (e.g. findall, assert) for usage.
  </li>
  <li>
  The predicate parsort/4 has been added to provide
  efficient and flexible sorting.  It can sort different argument
  positions of predicates lexicographically, in either ascending or
  descending order, and either eliminate duplicates or not.
  </li>
  <li>
  A new built-in set_file_write_depth/1 controls the depth of
  terms printed by standard I/O built-ins.
  </li>
  <li>
  Improvements have been made to the compiler for efficiency,
  and several bug fixes have been made to compiling and parsing.  In
  addition, singleton_warnings_off a new compiler option
  suppresses singleton warnings by the compiler, and so is useful for
  code generation.
  </li>
  <li>
  Improvements have been made to the ODBC interface, to allow
  multiple ODBC connections, to allow querying of information about
  the ODBC connection itself, and to allow data to be retrieved as
  character lists rather than as atoms.
  </li>
  <li>
  XSB disassembler output is now readable by Prolog.
  </li>
  <li>
  Predicates defined within a module, but not exported can be
  called from outside that module using the call Module:Call.
  The predicate @=/2 has been added that succeeds if two terms
  are identical variables, or if the main functor symbols of two terms
  to be compared are identical, and fails otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
  Improvements have been made to memory management, to better
  integrate heap garbage collection and heap stack expansion.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Selected Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Java 1.4.2 introduced some incompatibilities in memory
  management which broke InterProlog. This has been fixed in this
  version.  In addition, parameters may now be passed when invoking
  XSB from Java.
  </li>
  <li>
  The GPP pre-processor has been updated. Most notably among the
  new functionalities is that #include can, now, take a macro as an
  argument.
  </li>
  <li>
  XSB's stack reallocation is now aware of attributed variables
  and interrupt handlers.
  </li>
  <li>
  An inconsistency in the handling of declarations has been
  fixed. The inconsistency involved different handling of predicate
  names declared as P/A and P(_,_,_,...).
  </li>
  <li>
  message/2 has been fixed to properly deal with a list as
  its 1st argument.
  </li>
  <li>
  A long-standing register allocation bug in the compiler is now
  fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Optimizations and bug fixes have been made to the XASP Smodels
  interface.
  </li>
  <li>
  Various error fixes and improvements made to xsbdoc.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The implementation and interface of attributed variables has
  been changed to fix several inconsistencies and to allow attributes in
  different modules.  These changes were necessary for the CHR
  implementation and made the CLP(R) implementation unavailable.  CLP(R)
  style handling is available through CHR solvers included in the CHR
  package.
  </li>
  <li>
  The Oracle interface is no longer supported.  Its functionality
  can be obtained through either XSB's ODBC interface or through the
	new dbdrivers package.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.6 (Duff)</h2>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Version 2.6 contains a number of changes, including new packages and
libraries for generation of manuals from code documentation and for
answer set programming.  Version 2.6 also allows a user-modifiable
extension for byte-code files, whose default .xwam extension replaces
the previous .O extension.  Existing features Version 2.6 have been
improved  in various ways, from better exception handling, to a more
robust Windows implementation, to numerous bug-fixes.
</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The Chat engine has been removed. An optimized version of the
  SLG-WAM is now the single engine supported in XSB. The garbage
  collectors have been ported to this engine.
  </li>
  <li>
  Various aspects of XSB have been rewritten to support an
  ISO-compatible error handling mechanism in which exceptional
  conditions can be caught and handled by user programs.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed-depth indexing has been added for dynamic predicates.
  Using fixed-depth indexing a term in a given arguments may be indexed
  on the first five non-variable symbols.  Multiple-argument and
  alternative indices also work with fixed-depth indexing just as they
  do with outer functor indexing.
  </li>
  <li>
  Full-word integers are now supported in XSB via an implementation
  of boxed integers.
  </li>
  <li>
  Date and time routines have been added as standard
  predicates.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packages and Libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  A new package, xsbdoc, has been added.  xsbdoc supports a
  "literate programming" style, in which code-level comments can be used
  to generate manuals.  It is based in part on Ciao system's lpdoc.
  </li>
  <li>
  The XASP package provides an efficient interface to SModels from
  XSB.  It is a significant rewrite of the previous SModels interface.
  </li>
  <li>
  An ODBC interface to MySQL is now supported under Linux.  In
  addition, Prolog terms can now be written to and read from database
  strings.
  </li>
  <li> A new library, stdscan.P is provided containing a configurable
  scanner for text parsing.
  </li>
  <li>
  Updates to the major packages, including Flora-2 and XMC.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Platform stabilization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Stability of XSB on Windows has been improved in many ways,
  both when XSB is compiled with Cygwin/GCC, and when compiled by
  native windows compilers.  These changes include a better
  configuration mechanism for Windows, a robust XSB-calling-C
  interface, and better support for gpp preprocessing of Prolog files.
  In addition, many standard and library predicates have been
  stabilized for Windows, including cputime/1, directory query
  routines, path and file handling, the format.P library, and others.
  </li>
  <li>
  The build process has been fixed for 64-bit MIPS machine.  XSB
  should be easily portable to most 64-bit machines.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Several bugfixes have been made for the CLP(R) package, including
  expansion of math functions to include min/1, max/1, and pow/2.
  </li>
  <li>
  Hashing function have been changed to provide better indexing of
  longish strings.
  </li>
  <li>
  Various bugs in pathname handling were fixed, and differences in
  pathname handling between Unix and Windows were minimized.
  </li>
  <li>
  Bugs closed since last release (see <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=1176&atid=101176">Bugs</a>
  for more information): #585031, #569972, #723875, #535270, #683785,
  #666940, #637782, #635399, #524348, #626921, #449237, #706145,

  #531264
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The object files now have the .xwam extension instead of the .O
  extension.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <tt>xsb_undefined_predicate_hook</tt> has been
  deprecated. Instead, XSB now throws the exception of the form
  <tt>error(undefined_predicate(Name,Arity,ModName),ErrorMessage)</tt>
  when an undefined predicate is called. This exception can be caught
  and appropriate action can be taken.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.5 (Okocim)</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This is mostly a transitional release, where the major changes are the
move to use the SLG-WAM engine as default, and the introduction of
garbage collection support for this engine. Also, several important
memory management related bugs have been fixed, increasing the
system's stability considerably.
</p>

<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>
This is the last release to support the Chat engine.
</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  SLG-WAM stack management has been made the default rather than Chat.
  Chat is still available through a configuration option.
  </li>
  <li> A new heap garbage collector, called <tt> indirect </tt> has
  been made the default garbage collector for SLG-WAM.  In addition,
  the Chat sliding and copying garbage collectors now also work on the
  SLG-WAM configuration.
  </li>
  <li> New builtins round/2, ceil/2 and floor/2 for dealing with
  floating point numbers added.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Several memory management related bugs fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Minor bug in Prolog debugger fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed problem with NULL values and ODBC.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  None
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>FLORA News</h3>
<p>
Flora-2 is still a late alpha release, but there have been
considerable improvements in stability and speed.
This release fixes many bugs, eliminates some restrictions, and adds
new features.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The most important new feature is the ability to check for undefined
  predicates and methods in debug mode (see the manual regarding
  checking undefinedness checks). This feature simplifies debugging
  considerably.
  </li>
  <li>
  Flora compiler now checks if a tabled predicate depends on an update
  operation and issues appropriate warnings. Such dependency is
  considered to be a likely program bug.
  </li>
  <li>
  Numbered anonymous oids added (e.g., _#123). They behave like
  regular anonymous oids (_#) in the sense that they are substituted
  by a new oid. However, numbered oids can be referenced within the
  same clause (e.g., _#12[self-&gt;_#12]).
  </li>
  <li>
  Optimized compilation of path expressions and nested terms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.4 (Bavaria)</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  XSB now permits user programs to register hooks to be called when an
  undefined predicate is encountered. This and other (previously
  undocumented) hooks are described in the chapter titled <i>Hooks</i>
  in Manual Part 1.
  </li>
  <li> The <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~lmc/">XMC Model Checking
  System</a> is now included as a package in XSB.
  </li>
  <li>
  Local scheduling has been made the default scheduler.
  </li>
  <li> Uniform interface to various file operations (chdir, isdir,
  readable, etc.) through the predicate <tt>path_sysop/2</tt> and
  <tt>path_sysop/3</tt> (in module file_io). See Manual, Part 2
  (<i>Script Utilities</i>).
  </li>
  <li>
  New string matching function, <tt>string_match/4</tt>, which extends
  <tt>str_sub/3</tt> (<tt>string_match/4</tt> doesn't do pattern
  matching - use the <tt>regmatch</tt> package for that). See Manual,
  Part 2, (<i>String Manipulation</i>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fixed subsumption bug prompted by certain uses of functors and
  lists.  The bug appeared as an inability to unify a (falsely
  identified) answer with an answer template.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The meaning of argument 3 in predicate str_sub/3 has changed. It
  still represents the position of the substring match. However,
  offsets now start from 0, like other string functions, instead of 1.
  </li>
  <li>
  A number of new predicates have been added as a step towards ISO
  compatibility.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>FLORA News</h3>
<p>
This release of XSB contains an alpha release of a completely
redesigned and re-implemented FLORA system (now called FLORA-2). Here
is an incomplete list of the main new features of the system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Integrates F-logic, HiLog, and Transaction Logic into one coherent
  language
  </li>
  <li>
  Provides a new, flexible module system
  </li>
  <li>
  Better equality maintenance and support for inheritance
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for preprocessing
  </li>
  <li>
  Many more enhancements
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We recommend that Flora users should start using Flora-2, as the previous
version of Flora is no longer maintained and will eventually be deprecated.
</p>

<h2>Version 2.3 (Zombie)</h2>

<h3> General</h3>
<p>
A great number of bugs fixed, new features, performance improvements.
</p>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Subsumption:</b> In addition to variant-based tabling, XSB now
  provides tabling based on subsumption of calls. In such a
  "subsumption-based" tabled evaluation, answers from a more general
  subgoal are used to satisfy a subsumed (more specific) subgoal,
  thereby permitting greater reuse of computed results.  The tabling
  strategy may be chosen on a per predicate basis.  Subsumption-based
  tabling typically yields better performance in both time and space.
  However, subsumptive tabling is better suited to more declarative
  programs, as it may fail to give proper results in the presence of
  certain Prolog constructs such as var/1.  This implementation of
  subsumption-based tabling correctly evaluates normal logic programs
  which do not require subgoal delays.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Jumptable Emulator:</b> The system is now able to take advantage
  of special gcc features to implement a jumptable-based emulator,
  which speeds up XSB considerably.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Sockets:</b> XSB now supports the socket select call and
  timeouts.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>RDF parser:</b> The XSB libwww package that first appeared in XSB
  2.2 now has new interface to the RDF parser provided by e libwww
  package from W3C.  It requires that the libwww library from W3C is
  installed.
  </li>
  <li>
  An ISO-compatable <b>throw/catch mechanism</b>: It was already
  present in version 2.2, but now it is also documented.
  </li>
  <li>
  Foreign C interface now works on SGI's IRIX.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Backtrackable assert and retract</b>, plus Perl-style associative
  arrays. (Read about them in the section on modifying the database in
  Manual 1.)
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Oracle Interface:</b> The Oracle interface has been brought
  up-to-date with newer versions of Oracle.
  </li>
  <li><b>ODBC Interface:</b> The ODBC interface has been some major
  cleanups, and several bugs have been fixed; it also now works with
  SQL Server as well as Access. Support for multiple simultaneous
  connections has been introduced.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The type <tt>bool</tt> used by the external C interface has
  been renamed to xsbBool, because of clashes with various include
  files that exist on some platforms. Likewise, the macros for dealing
  with the variable string type used by C programs that call XSB as a
  library have been renamed. For instance, <tt>vstrDEFINE</tt> is now
  <tt>XSB_StrDefine</tt>. See Vol. 2 of the manual for the new names.
  </li>
  <li>
  The predicates <tt>file_read_line</tt>,
  <tt>file_read_line_atom</tt>, <tt>file_read_line_list</tt> have lost
  the last argument (the indicator of whether the read has read the
  entire line). This argument is no longer necessary, since buffers
  expand automatically to accommodate any size input.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.2 (Tsingtao)</h2>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Support of Attributed Variables:</b> Attributed variables are now
  supported in XSB (partially compatible with SICStus 3.8).  See <a
  href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Volume 2, Attributed
  Variables.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Random Number Generator:</b> A builtin random number generator is
  implemented, and a set of predicates, which are compatible with
  SICStus 3.8, are provided.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>New Packages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b><tt>libwww</tt></b> - a powerful Web access package. See <a
  href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Volume 2, The Libwww
  Package.</a> This package has been tested only on Solaris 2.6 and
  Linux 2.2. It definitely needs configuration work in order to run
  under Windows.
  <br>
  This XSB package relies on the W3C's libwww library and requires it to
  be installed. The entire package is implemented in C and is much faster
  than other related Internet access packages for Prolog, e.g., PiLLOW). The
  package provides the following functionality:
  <ul>
    <li>
    HTML parser.
    </li>
    <li>
    (Non-validating) XML parser (including handling of external
    entities).
    </li>
    <li>
    The ability to simultaneously dispatch several HTTP requests and
    parse the responses as they arrive; no waiting until the entire
    document is received.
    </li>
    <li>
    Fetching web pages and filling out forms.
    </li>
    <li>
    Header information.
    </li>
    <li>
    Timeouts.
    </li>
    <li>
    Basic and digest  authentication. SSL to follow.
    </li>
    <li>
    Redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
    Error handling.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  The C calls <tt>xsb_query_string_string</tt> and
  <tt>xsb_next_string</tt> that interface C programs to XSB now use
  the new <tt>VarString</tt> data type instead of <tt>char*</tt>. It
  is no longer necessary to pass the size of the buffer to these
  functions. See XSB Manual, Volume 2, to learn more about the
  variable-length string data type.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Crashing of XSB-ODBC interface under Windows;
  </li>
  <li>
  Memory violations of some internal operations on delay lists.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1 (Skol)</h2>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>
<p>
<b>Process management API:</b> XSB can now spawn subprocesses and
capture their standard I/O into XSB streams. This allows XSB to
communicate with other processes. See <a href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB
Manual, Volume 2, Communication with Subprocesses.</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>XSB preprocessor:</b> There is now a compiler option, <tt>xpp_on</tt>,
which tells the XSB compiler to put the source through a
preprocessor. The default is <a
href="http://www.math.polytechnique.fr/cmat/auroux/prog/gpp.html">gpp</a>,
a powerful preprocessor that understands both C and Prolog syntax.
</p>
<p>
<b>High-level C interface:</b> XSB can now automatically generate
wrappers for the most common C functions. Such functions can now be
simply declared using compiler directives and then be called from XSB.
</p>
<p>
<B>Enhancements to the sockets interface:</B> New calls such as
<tt>socket_set_option, socket_select,</tt>, etc. Certain socket calls
and file I/O calls can be timed-out.
</p>
<p>
<b>I/O enhancements:</b> There are several additions to the low-level
I/O library, such as <tt>file_clone, file_reopen,
pipe_open</tt>. Certain socket calls and file I/O calls can be
timed-out.
</p>
<p>
<b>New section on string manipulation in manual part 2:</b> Some of
the predicates described there are old (but weren't documented) and
some are new.
</p>
<p>
<b>Call changes:</b> New calls: number_digits/2, number_codes/2,
atom_codes/2 replace atom_chars/2 and number_chars/2.
</p>
<p>
<b>Atom length:</b> Atom length in compiled code is no longer limited
to 255. The 255 limit on the size of ldoptions directive in the
Foreign C interface has been removed as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Debugger enhancements:</b> Many additional options: profiling,
verbose skip, extensive trace control facility.
</p>

<h3>New Packages</h3>
<p>
<b>sModels</b>: Implements stable model semantics.
</p>

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Binary incompatibility!!!</b> The format of the XSB .O files has
  been changed. Make sure you recompile all your programs! (The
  binaries that come with the XSB distribution have the new format.)
  </li>
  <li>
  <tt>unix/1</tt> is now called <tt>shell/1</tt>. It exists in module
  <tt>shell</tt>, and is imported from there automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
  The standard predicates atom_chars/2 and number_codes/2 now behave
  as in the Prolog standard (return lists of atoms rather than ASCII
  codes). The old behavior is provided by the standard predicates
  atom_codes/2 and number_codes/2.
  </li>
  <li>
  A number of backward-incompatible changes in socket calls. First,
  the predicates socket_send_eof/1 and socket_send_asci/2 have been
  removed. This functionality is available through other calls.
  </li>
  <br>
  Second, all socket predicates now have an extra argument, the error
  code. The old-style predicates have been preserved, but their
  behavior isn't guaranteed to be 100% the same. The fileptr argument
  in socket_connect call has been deleted. The fileptr argument in
  socket_accept no longer denotes an XSB I/O port. Instead, it denoted
  a socket descriptor. It can be converted to an I/O port using the
  new builtin fd2ioport.
  <br>
  socket_send/3 no longer appends the message delimited (the
  backquote). Programs that rely on this feature will not work any
  longer. Instead of this old hack, socket_send now prepends a 4-byte
  header that specifies the length of the message body. The primitive
  socket_recv/3 uses it to determine the length of the message it
  received.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0 (Gouden Carolus)</h2>

<h3> General</h3>
<p>
XSB Version 2.0 offers a more flexible handling of dynamic code. XSB
now also includes a number of preprocessors that allow it to
efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic, Annotated
logic, and the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
Finally, XSB 2.0 provides various packages for regular expression and
wildcard matching.
</p>
<p>
Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses. The result is
a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
</p>
<p>
Added support for <a
href="http://www.declarativa.com/interprolog">InterProlog</a>, a Java
front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>
</p>

<h3> Packages</h3>
<p>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <i>FLORA</i>: A full-fledged F-logic to XSB compiler and shell.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>GAP</i>: support for annotated logic programming.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>SLX</i>: allows XSB to evaluate extended logic programs according
  to the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>PERLMATCH</i>: an interface to Perl pattern matching and string
  substitution capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>REGMATCH</i>: provides similar functionality, but relies on a
  POSIX-compliant C library instead of Perl.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>WILDMATCH</i>: allows matching wildcards and globbing of
  directories. Relies on a POSIX 2 compliant C library.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
The following incompatible changes have been made in XSB Version 2.0:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The file .xsbrc in the home directory is no longer used. Instead, XSB
  now uses the directory .xsb/ and the startup file is .xsb/xsbrc
  It is now possible to have pretty much any Prolog code in that file.
  </li>
  <li>
  There is a change in how the library_directory predicate is used.
  The user must now assert directories into this predicate.
  There is no need to export this predicate (this predicate is now
  global).
  </li>
  <li>
  XSB is no longer supported on MS DOS.
  </li>
  <li>
  In order to be consistent with the ISO Prolog standard, XSB no
  longer supports mixing compiled and dynamic code for the same
  predicate.
  </li>
  <li>
  The predicate is_string/1, which used to check if its argument is a list of
  characters, is now replaced by the builtin is_charlist/1. There is now also
  is_charlist/2 (see the manual).
  </li>
</ul>
