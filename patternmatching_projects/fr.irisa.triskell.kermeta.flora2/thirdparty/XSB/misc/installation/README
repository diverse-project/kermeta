
mailarchive.pl is a Perl script that reads mailbox and extracts
installation logs. 
The fields to be extracted are specified in the file datafields.cfg

The logs are converted to Prolog format and are appended to the file archive.P.

Installation messages are then deleted and the remaining messages are
appended to the user local mailbox.

How to use:
1. Subscribe some account to xsb-installation@lists.sourceforge.net
   It is recommended to use a separate account for that, so that
   mailarchive.pl won't interfere with your regular mail.
2. Install this program.
3. Let cron run it every day.
