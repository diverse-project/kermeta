%   numbervars(+Term, +FirstN, ?LastN) 
%   Each variable in the HiLog Term is instantiated to a term of the form 
%   '$VAR'(N), where N is an integer starting from FirstN. FirstN is used
%   as the value of  N  for the first variable in Term (starting from the 
%   left).  The second distinct variable in  Term  is given a value  of N
%   satisfying "N is FirstVar + 1";  the third distinct variable gets the 
%   value FirstVar+2, and so on.  The last variable in Term has the value 
%   LastVar-1.
