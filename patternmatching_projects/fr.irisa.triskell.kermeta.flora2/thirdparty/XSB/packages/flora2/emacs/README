
    Emacs major mode for Flora.
    ==========================

Put flora.el in a directory that is on the load path of Emacs or XEmacs.
The easiest way is to have a separate directory for emacs libraries.
A directory can be added to emacs search path by putting the following in
the file ~/.emacs (or ~/.xemacs, if you are running one of the newer
versions of XEmacs):

(setq load-path (cons "your-directory" load-path))

It is also a good idea to compile emacs libraries. To compile flora.el,
use this:

emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile flora.el

(if you are using XEmacs, use xemacs, of course --- the two emacsen often use
incompatible byte code.)

Finally, you must tell X/Emacs which files are Flora files, so it would
invoke the Flora major mode automatically:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.flr$" . flora-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'flora-mode "flora" "Major mode for editing Flora programs." t)
