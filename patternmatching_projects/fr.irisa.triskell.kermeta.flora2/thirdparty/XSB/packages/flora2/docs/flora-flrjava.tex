      Pandit and Michael Kifer}


     This chapter documents the API for accessing \FLORA from a Java program.
  The API has two versions: a \emph{low-level API},
  which enables Java programs to
  send arbitrary queries to \FLORA and get results, and a \emph{high-level
    API}, which is more limited, but is easier to use. The high-level API
  establishes a correspondence between Java classes and \FLORA classes,
  which enables manipulation of \FLORA classes by executing appropriate
  methods on the corresponding Java classes. Both interfaces rely on the
  Java-XSB interface, called \emph{Interprolog}, provided by Declarativa.com.


\section{Description}
\subsection{The Low-level Interface}
 The low-level API enables Java programs to send arbitrary queries
to \FLORA and get results. 

In order to be able to access \FLORA, the Java program must first establish
a session for a running instance of \FLORA. Multiple sessions can be active
at the same time. The knowledge bases in the different running instances
are completely independent. Sessions are instances of
the {\tt
net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.FloraSession}. This class provides methods
for opening/closing sessions and loading \FLORA knowledge bases
(which are also used in the high-level
interface). In addition, a session provides 
methods for executing arbitrary \FLORA queries. The following is the complete
list of the methods that are available in that class.
\begin{itemize}
\item
\begin{verbatim}
public FloraSession()
\end{verbatim}
    This method creates a connection to an instance of \FLORA.
The initialization parameters needed are:

{\tt JAVA\_BIN}. This variable points to the directory containing
the javac and java executable programs. This variable is specified in
the {\tt windowsVariables.bat} and  {\tt unixVariables.sh}  files in the
{\tt java} subdirectory of the \FLORA distribution.

{\tt XSB\_ROOT\_DIRECTORY}. This variable points to the directory
containing the XSB executable. This variable is specified in the {\tt
  flora\_settings.bat} and {\tt flora\_settings.sh} files in the {\tt java}
directory.  {\tt FLORA\_DIRECTORY}. This variable points to the directory
containing the \FLORA installation. This variable is specified in the {\tt
  flora\_settings.bat} and {\tt flora\_settings.sh} files in the {\tt java}
directory.  Both of these files are generated automatically by the {\tt
  makeflora} script and should be of no concern to the user under normal
circumstances.
\item {\tt close()} \\
  This method must be called to terminate a \FLORA session. Note that this does
  not terminate the Java program that initiated the session:
  to exit the Java program that talks to \FLORA, one needs to execute
  the statement
  %%
\begin{verbatim}
 System.exit();  
\end{verbatim}
  %%
  Note that just returning from the {\tt main} method is not enough. 

\item
\begin{verbatim}
public Iterator ExecuteQuery(String command)
\end{verbatim}
    This method executes the \FLORA command given by the
parameter {\tt command}.  This method is used to execute \FLORA queries that
do not require variable bindings to be returned back to Java or queries that
have only
a single variable to be returned. Each binding is represented as
an instance of {\tt net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.FloraObject}.
The examples below illustrate how to process the results returned by this
method.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
public Iterator ExecuteQuery(String query, Vector vars)
\end{verbatim}
  This method executes the \FLORA query given by the first argument. The
  Vector {\tt vars} (of strings) specifies the names of all the variables
  in the query for which bindings need to be returned. These variables are
  added to the vector using the method {\tt add} before calling
  {\tt ExecuteQuery}. For instance, {\tt vars.add("?X")}.  
  
  This version of {\tt ExecuteQuery} returns an iterator over all bindings
  returned by the \FLORA query.  Each binding is represented by a {\tt
    HashMap} 
  object which can be used to obtain the value of each variable in the
  query (using the {\tt get()} method). The value of each variable returned
  is an instance of {\tt
    net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.FloraObject}.

  See the examples below for how to handle the results
  returned by this method.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
void loadFile(String fileName,String moduleName)
\end{verbatim}
  This method loads the \FLORA program, specified by the parameter {\tt
    fileName} into the \FLORA module specified in {\tt moduleName}.
\end{itemize}

The code snippet below illustrates the low-level API.

\paragraph{Step 1: Writing a \FLORA program.}
  Let us assume that we have a file, called  {\tt flogic\_basics.flr},
  which contains the following information:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
person :: object.
dangerous_hobby :: object.
john:employee.
employee::person.

bob:person.
tim:person.
betty:employee.

person[age=>integer,
       kids=>person,
       salary(year)=>value,
       hobbies=>hobby,
       believes_in*=>something,
       instances => person
].

mary:employee[
    age->29,
    kids -> {tim,leo,betty},
    salary(1998) -> a_lot
].

tim[hobbies -> {stamps, snowboard}].
betty[hobbies->{fishing,diving}].

snowboard:dangerous_hobby.
diving:dangerous_hobby.

?_X[self-> ?_X].

person[believes_in *-> {something, something_else}].
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Step 2:  Writing a JAVA application to interface with \FLORA.}
 The following code loads a \FLORA program from a file and then passes
 queries to the knowledge base.

\begin{verbatim}
import net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.*;
import java.util.*;

public class flogicbasicsExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create a new session for a running instance of FLORA-2
        FloraSession session = new FloraSession();
        System.out.println("FLORA-2 session started");

        // Assume that Java was called with -DFLORA_FILE=the-file-name
        String fileName = System.getProperty("FLORA_FILE");
        if(fileName == null || fileName.trim().length() == 0) {
            System.out.println("Invalid path to example file!");
            System.exit(0);

        }
        // load the FLORA-2 program into module basic_mod
        session.loadFile(fileName,"basic_mod");

        /* Running queries from flogic_basics.flr */

        /* Query for persons */
        String command = "?X:person@basic_mod.";
        System.out.println("Query:"+command);
        Iterator personObjs = session.ExecuteQuery(command);

        /* Printing out the person names and information about their kids */
        while (personObjs.hasNext()) {
            FloraObject personObj = (FloraObject)personObjs.next();
            System.out.println("Person name:"+personObj);


        command = "person[instances -> ?X]@basic_mod.";
        System.out.println("Query:"+command);
        personObjs = session.ExecuteQuery(command);

        /* Prining out the person names  */
        while (personObjs.hasNext()) {
            Object personObj = personObjs.next();
            System.out.println("Person Id: "+personObj);
        }

        /* Example of ExecuteQuery with two arguments */
        Vector vars = new Vector();
        vars.add("?X");
        vars.add("?Y");

        Iterator allmatches =
            session.ExecuteQuery("?X[believes_in -> ?Y]@basic_mod.",vars);
        System.out.println("Query:?X[believes_in -> ?Y]@basic_mod.");
        while(allmatches.hasNext()) {
            HashMap firstmatch = (HashMap)allmatches.next();
            Object Xobj = firstmatch.get("?X");
            Object Yobj = firstmatch.get("?Y");
            System.out.println(Xobj+" believes in: "+?Yobj);
        }
        // quit the system
        session.close();
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{The High-Level Interface}

The high-level API operates by creating proxy Java classes for 
\FLORA classes selected by the user.
This enables the Java program to operate on \FLORA classes by
executing appropriate methods on the corresponding proxy Java classes.
The use of the high-level API involves a number of stages, as described below.

\paragraph{Stage 1: Writing a \FLORA file.}
We assume the same {\tt flogic\_basics.flr} file as in the previous
example.

\paragraph{Stage 2: Generating Java classes that serve as proxies for \FLORA classes.}
The \FLORA side of the Java-to-\FLORA high level API provides a predicate
to generate Java proxy classes for each \fl class which have a signature
declaration in the \FLORA knowledge base. A proxy class gets defined so
that it would have methods to manipulate the attributes and methods of the
corresponding \fl class for which signature declarations are available.  If
an \fl class has a declared value-returning attribute {\tt foobar} then the
proxy class will have the following methods. Each method name has the form
\emph{action}$S_1S_2S_3$\_{\tt foobar}, where \emph{action} is either {\tt
  get}, {\tt set}, or {\tt delete}. The specifier $S_1$ indicates the type
of the method --- {\tt V} for value-returning, {\tt B} for Boolean, and
{\tt P} for procedural. The specifier $S_2$ tells whether the operation
applies to the signature of the method ({\tt S}), e.g., {\tt
  person[foobar=>string]}, or to the actual data ({\tt D}), for example,
{\tt john[foobar->3]}.  Finally, the specifier $S_3$ tells if the operation
applies to the inheritable variant of the method ({\tt I})
or its non-inheritable variant ({\tt N}).
%% 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt public Iterator getVDI\_foobar()}\\
  {\tt public Iterator getVDN\_foobar()}
  \\
  {\tt public Iterator getVSI\_foobar()}\\
  {\tt public Iterator getVSN\_foobar()}
  \\
  The above methods query the knowledge base and get all answers for the
  attribute {\tt foobar}. They return iterators through which these answers
  can be processed one-by-one. Each object returned by the iterator is of
  type {\tt FloraObject}.  The {\tt getVDN} form queries non-inheritable
  data methods and {\tt getVDI} the inheritable ones. The {\tt getVSI} and
  {\tt getVSN} forms query the signatures of the attribute {\tt foobar}.
\item {\tt public boolean setVDI\_foobar(Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVDN\_foobar(Vector value)}
  \\
  {\tt public boolean setVSI\_foobar(Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVSN\_foobar(Vector value)}
  \\
  These methods
  add values to the set of values returned by the attribute {\tt foobar}. The
  values must be placed in the vector parameter passed these methods.
  Again, {\tt setVDN} adds data for non-inheritable methods and {\tt setVDI}
  is used for inheritable methods.
  {\tt setVSI} and {\tt setVSN} add types to signatures.  
\item {\tt public boolean setVDI\_foobar(Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVDN\_foobar(Object value)}
  \\
  {\tt public boolean setVSI\_foobar(Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVSN\_foobar(Object value)}\\
  These methods provide a simplified interface when only one value needs to
  be added.  It works like the earlier set\_* methods, except that only one
  value given as an argument is added.
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar(Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar(Vector value)}
  \\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSI\_foobar(Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSN\_foobar(Vector value)}
  \\
  Delete a set of values of the attribute {\tt foobar}. The set is
  specified in the vector argument.
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar(Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar(Object value)}
  \\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSI\_foobar(Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSN\_foobar(Object value)}
  \\
  A simplified interface for the case when only one value needs to be deleted.
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar()}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar()}
  \\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSI\_foobar()}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVSN\_foobar()}
  \\
  Delete all values for the attribute {\tt foobar}. 
\end{enumerate}
%% 
For \fl methods with arguments, the high-level API provides Java methods as
above, but they take more arguments to accommodate the parameters that \fl
methods take. Let us
assume that the \fl method is called {\tt foobar2} and it takes parameters
{\tt arg1} and {\tt arg2}.  As before the {\tt getVDI\_*}, {\tt setVDI\_*},
etc., forms of the Java methods are for dealing with inheritable \FLORA
methods and the {\tt getVDN\_*}, {\tt setVDN\_*},
etc., forms are for dealing with non-inheritable \FLORA methods.

%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt public Iterator getVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2)}\\
  {\tt public Iterator getVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2)}
  \\
  Obtain all values for the \fl method invocation {\tt foobar2(arg1,arg2)}.
\item {\tt public boolean setVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Vector value)}
  \\
  Add a set of methods specified in the parameter {\tt value} for the method
  invocation {\tt foobar2(arg1,arg2)}. 
\item {\tt public boolean setVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean setVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Object value)}
  \\
  A simplified interface when only one value is to be added.
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Vector value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Vector value)}
  \\
  Delete a set of values from {\tt foobar2(arg1,arg2)}. The set is given by
  the vector parameter {\tt value}. 
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Object value)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2, Object value)}
  \\
  A simplified interface for deleting a single value.
\item {\tt public boolean deleteVDI\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2)}\\
  {\tt public boolean deleteVDN\_foobar2(Object arg1, Object arg2)}
  \\
  Delete all values for the method invocation {\tt foobar2(arg1,arg2)}. 
\end{enumerate}
%% 
For Boolean and procedural methods, the generated methods are similar
except that there is only one version for the set and delete methods. In
addition, Boolean inheritable methods use the {\tt getBDI\_*}, {\tt
  setBDI\_*}, etc., form, while non-inheritable methods use the {\tt
  getBDN\_*}, etc., form.  Procedural methods use the {\tt getPDI\_*}, {\tt
  getPDN\_*}, etc., forms.  For instance,
%% 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\tt public boolean getBDI\_foobar3()}   \\
  {\tt public boolean getBDN\_foobar3()} \\
  {\tt public boolean getPDI\_foobar3()}   \\
  {\tt public boolean getPDN\_foobar3()}
\item {\tt public boolean setBDI\_foobar3()}   \\
  {\tt public boolean setBDN\_foobar3()} \\
  {\tt public boolean setPDI\_foobar3()}   \\
  {\tt public boolean setPDN\_foobar3()}
\item {\tt public boolean deleteBDI\_foobar3()}  \\
  {\tt public boolean deleteBDN\_foobar3()}  \\
  {\tt public boolean deletePDI\_foobar3()}  \\
  {\tt public boolean deletePDN\_foobar3()}  
\end{enumerate}
%% 

In addition, the methods to query the ISA hierarchy are available:
%% 
\begin{itemize}
\item  {\tt public Iterator getDirectInstances()}
\item  {\tt public Iterator getInstances()}
\item  {\tt public Iterator getDirectSubClasses()}
\item  {\tt public Iterator getSubClasses()}
\item   {\tt public Iterator getSuperClasses()}   
\item   {\tt public Iterator getDirectSuperClasses()}   
\end{itemize}
%% 
These methods apply to the java proxy object that corresponds to the \fl
class person.

All these methods are generated automatically by executing the following
\FLORA query, where all arguments must be bound:
%% 
\begin{verbatim}
 // %write(?Class,?Module,?ProxyClassFileName).
 ?- %write(foo,example,'myproject/foo.java').
\end{verbatim}
%% 
The first argument specifies the class for which to generate the methods,
the file name tells where to put the Java file for the proxy object,
and the model argument tells which \FLORA model to load this program to. The
result of this execution will be the file {\tt foo.java} which should be
included with your java program (the program that is going to interface with
\FLORA). Note that because of Java conventions, the file name must have
the same name as the class name.
It is important to remember, however, that proxy methods will
be generated only for those \fl methods that have been declared using
signatures.

Let us now come back to our program {\tt flogic\_basics.flr} for which we
want to use the high-level API.  Suppose we want to query the person class.
To generate the proxy declarations for that class, we create
the file {\tt person.java} for the 
module {\tt basic\_mod} as follows.
%%
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
?- flLoad('examples/flogic_basics'>>basic_mod).
?- flLoad(javaAPI).
?- %write(person,basic_mod,'examples/person.java')
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


The {\tt \%write} method will create the file {\tt person.java} shown
below.  The methods defined in {\tt person.java} are the class constructors
for {\tt person}, the methods to query the ISA hierarchy, and the ``get'',
``set'' and ``delete'' methods for each method and attribute declared in
the \FLORA class {\tt person}.  The parameters for the ``get'', ``set'' and
``delete'' Java methods are the same as for the corresponding \FLORA
methods. The first constructor for class {\tt person} takes a low-level
object of class {\tt net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.FloraObject} as a
parameter. The second parameter is the \FLORA module for which the proxy
object is to be created.
The second {\tt person}-constructor takes \fl object Id instead of a
low-level {\tt FloraObject}. It also takes the module name, as before, but,
in addition, it takes a session for a running \FLORA instance.
The session parameter was not needed for the first {\tt person}-constructor
because {\tt FloraObject} is already attached to a concrete session.  

It can be seen from the form of the proxy object constructors that
proxy objects are attached to specific \FLORA modules, which may seem to
go against the general philosophy that \fl objects do not belong to any
module --- only their methods do. On closer examination, however, attaching
high-level proxy Java objects to modules makes perfect sense. Indeed, a
proxy object encapsulates operations for manipulating \fl attributes 
and methods, which belong to concrete \FLORA modules, so the proxy object
needs to know which module it operates upon.

\paragraph{Stage 3: Writing Java application programs.}

The following program ({\tt flogicbasicsExample.java}) shows several
queries that use the high-level interface. The
class {\tt person.java} is generated at the previous stage.
The methods of the high-level interface operate on Java objects that are
proxies for \FLORA objects. These Java objects are members of the class
{\tt net.sourceforge.flora.javaAPI.src.FloraObject}.
Therefore, before one can use the high-level methods one need to first
retrieve the appropriate proxy objects on which to operate. This is done
by sending an appropriate query through the method {\tt ExecuteQuery}---the
same method that was used in the low-level interface.
Alternatively, {\tt person}-objects could be constructed using the
3-argument proxy constructor, which takes \fl oids.

\paragraph{Stage 4: Running the Java application program.}
To run Java programs that interface with \FLORA, one must follow the
following guidelines.

\begin{itemize}
\item Place the files {\tt flogicsbasicsExample.java} (the program you have
  written) and {\tt person.java} (the automatically generated file)
in the same directory and compile them using the {\tt javac}  command. Add
the directories containing the API code (i.e., the correct path name of the
directory {\tt .../flora2/java/API}) and the {\tt
interprolog.jar} file to the Java classpath.


\item Run the code using the following command (for Unix, change {\tt
    \%VAR\%} to {\tt \$VAR} and replace $\backslash$ with {\tt /}).
\begin{verbatim}
%JAVA_BIN%\java -DXSB_ROOT_DIRECTORY=%XSB_ROOT_DIRECTORY%
                -DFLORA_DIRECTORY=%FLORA_DIRECTORY%
                -Djava.library.path=%XSB_ROOT_DIRECTORY%
                -DENGINE=%ENGINE%
                -classpath %CLASSPATH% flogicbasicsExample
\end{verbatim}

  The above command uses several shell variables, which are explained below.
  Instead of using the variables, one can substitute their values directly.

{\tt JAVA\_BIN}: This variable should point to the directory
containing the {\tt java}  and {\tt javac}  executables.

{\tt XSB\_ROOT\_DIRECTORY}: This variable should be set to the
directory containing the XSB executable.

{\tt FLORA\_DIRECTORY}: This variable should be set to the directory
containing the \FLORA system.

{\tt ENGINE}: This variable should be set to
{\tt Native} or  {\tt Subprocess}. The variable indicates whether InterProlog
should use the Java Native Interface (JNI) or sockets to communicate with \FLORA.

{\tt CLASSPATH}: This variable should point to the directory
containing the API code (i.e., the correct path name of the
directory {\tt .../flora2/java/API})  and the file {\tt interprolog.jar}
(see below).

\end{itemize}

\section{Configuring the System}
The Java-to-\FLORA interface needs XSB, \FLORA, Java, and the
Interprolog library to be installed and configured. Here are the
configuration steps.

\begin{itemize}
\item Download J2SE 1.4.2 (or newer) from
  {\tt http://java.sun.com/j2se/},
and install it in some directory, say {\tt MY\_JAVA\_DIR}.
\item On Linux and other Unix-based systems,
  XSB needs to be configured in a special way
in order to interoperate with InterProlog. To build XSB with
InterProlog support, run the following commands in the {\tt build}
subdirectory of XSB.
The {\tt configure} script needs to be run only on Linux and
other Unix-based systems.
%%
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --with-interprolog
            --site-includes='MY_JAVA_DIR/includes MY_JAVA_DIR/includes/linux'
./makexsb
./makexsb dynmodule.
\end{verbatim}
%%
{\tt --site-includes} is needed only if Java is installed in a non-standard
place where {\tt configure} cannot find it automatically.

Under Cygwin, XSB also needs to be configured as above, but the last step,
{\tt ./makexsb dynmodule}, should be dropped.

\item Under Windows, XSB is distributed preconfigured for use with
  Interprolog. However, if you still need to rebuild it, use the following
  command sequence. First, you would need to configure XSB \emph{under
    Cygwin} (it is not possible to configure XSB under native Windows!) in a
  Cygwin terminal window.  
  %% 
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --with-interprolog
            --with-wind
            --site-includes='MY_JAVA_DIR\includes MY_JAVA_DIR\includes\win32'
\end{verbatim}
  %% 
  The path names in {\tt --site-include} must be Windows path names, not
  Cygwin's.

  Then, in a Windows (not Cygwin) command terminal, type:
  %% 
\begin{verbatim}
makexsb_wind  
\end{verbatim}
  %% 
  Note: this assumes that {\tt nmake} and the C++ compiler are available on
  your system. See the \FLORA manual, Section 1, for the instructions on
  obtaining these programs.
\item Rebuild \FLORA with the new XSB binary obtained in the
previous step.
\item Get InterProlog from {\tt http://www.declarativa.com/interprolog/}
and put it in the {\tt java}  folder of the \FLORA distribution.
(Do this only if you need a newer version of InterProlog. \FLORA
distribution already includes a version of {\tt interprolog.jar} in the
{\tt java} subdirectory).
\item The {\tt java/API/net} subdirectory in the \FLORA distribution
  consists of the system code for the interface.
  Sample applications are found in the {\tt java/API/examples}  folder.
\item To build the code for the interface, use the scripts {\tt build.bat} or
  {\tt build.sh} in the {\tt java/API}  folder (depending on whether you are
  using Windows or Unix).
\item To build the the examples, use the scripts
  {\tt buildExample.bat} or  {\tt buildExample.sh} in the {\tt java/API/examples}
  folder. For instance, to
  build the {\tt flogicbasicsExample} example, use the commands
\begin{verbatim}
cd examples
buildExample.sh flogicbasicsExample
(or buildExample.bat flogicbasicsExample, for Windows)
\end{verbatim}
\item To run the demos, use the scripts
{\tt runExample.bat} and  {\tt runExample.sh}  in the {\tt java/API/examples}
folder. For instance, to
run the {\tt flogicbasicsExample},  use the commands
\begin{verbatim}
runExample.sh flogicbasicsExample
(or runExample.bat flogicbasicsExample , for Windows)
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
