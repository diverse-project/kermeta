This Perl program converts from the old syntax of FLORA-2 to the new syntax
where variables are prefixed with a ?, ->>, =>>, .., !! are eliminated, single-valued signatures are represented by {1:1}=> and {1:1}*=>,
transactional methods start with a %, etc.

******
Usage: 
******
	cp -r DIRECTORY BACKUP_DIRECTORY
	       Back up the directory to be converted.
	       Otherwise the old version will be lost.
	perl convert.pl OPTION DIRECTORY
	       OPTION indicates the convertion to be performed
		      -var_trans makes the changes (1) and (2) below.
		      -single_multi does (3).
		      -all does (1), (2), and (3)

*******************
Types of conversion
*******************
 convert.pl modifies all the .flr files in DIRECTORY and its subdirectories
 as follows:

 (1) Adds a '?' in front of every FLORA-2 variable (in the old syntax)

 (2) Replaces '#' with '%' in procedural predicates and methods.

 (3) Replaces "=>" with "{1:1}=>" and "*=>" with "{1:1}*=>";
     Replaces "=>>" with "=>" and "->>" with "->";
     Replaces "!!" with "!" and a..b with a.b.

**********
Limitations
**********

 (1) This program handles only .flr files.

 (2) This program may add a '?' before user-defined macros (in #define
     statements). All the '?'s right before macros should be deleted after
     executing this program.

 (3) This program doesn't add '?' in comments and quoted text. 
 
 (4) There may be places where # was used other than for specifying
     procedural predicates and terms. These #'s may have to be converted
     back to %.

 (5) There may be other limitations or bugs. If you find any, please contact:
