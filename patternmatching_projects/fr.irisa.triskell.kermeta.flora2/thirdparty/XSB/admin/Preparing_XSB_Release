    =========================================

NOTE: Instructions for maintenance of the Web site are in
      docs/homepage/SOURCEFORGE_SITE_MAINTENANCE

NOTE: Autoconf must be installed. 
      Releases can only be created under a Unix system

1. Windows NT/95/98/2000

       cd build
       autoconf
   Windows:
       ./configure --with-os=windows

   Note: you MUST run configure, or else certain important files
   (configs.h, configure.P, banner.msg)  won't be created!
   Windows users cannot run this configure script!


   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation.

   Add these directories to the distribution tarball:
       
       Windows:
	   config/x86-pc-windows


2. Unix:

   cd build
   autoconf  (just to make sure that `configure' is up-to-date)

   NOTE: don't run ./configure! Unix users must run it by themselves!

3. ALL:

   Make sure all Prolog files have been compiled:

   cd <top XSB dir>
   make


4. ALL:

   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation.

   Tar up these directories (in addition to those indicated above):

       emu
       etc
       lib
       syslib
       cmplib
       packages
       examples
       build  	      (not necessary for Windows)
