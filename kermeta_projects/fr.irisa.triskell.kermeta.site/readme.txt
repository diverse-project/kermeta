Deploying a new version of Kermeta


- generate the documentation
	- you need to chekout the porject Docbook_projects/ant-docbook-styler from lievre
	- then from fr.irisa.triskell/kermeta.documentation/src run one of the Kermeta*_build.xml
		it will unzip and install the antdocbook styler files in your workspace. 
		On unix/linux systyem you may have path troubles if someone has commited u
		nnecessary files in the cvs (that twould have been regenerated by ant-docbook-style otherwise)
	- check the path in common_build.xml so the files will be copied to to web site. 
	(eventually copy them manually if you prefer)
	the webdeploy_build.xml should do all the work (generating all the documentation and deploying it)
- traceability
 chekout from lievre
 generate model, edit, editor (the traceability.genmodel should be ok)
 
- Kermeta
	- you must change or check all the	version number in the plugin.xml, feature.xml and site.xml files
	 (including the documentation and the raceability)
	-in the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta project update the file about.properties
	
	- use the site.xml   pde/builder   to compiler everything
	- deploy it locally in your current configuration using a local site update (not the remote one !)
 	and test the version
 	

 if ok 
	- check the new features, corrected bugs, improvement done in this version (ask every developers
	 and cross chek in the trackers
	 	eventually update the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.site/history.html file with all those changes
	 close the issues corresponding issues in the tracker
	 eventually check and update the tasks tracker too.

eventually backup the existing version

use the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.site/copy_build.xml to deploy the plugin in the site update.
backup this new version on the web site


- tag the version
- generate a zip from the feature export, post it on the file section of the gforge 
	(do not forget the change history)
- send a mail on the kermeta-users list
- create a news on the forge
