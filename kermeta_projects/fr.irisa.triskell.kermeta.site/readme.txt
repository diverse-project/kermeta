Deploying a new version of Kermeta


- generate the documentation
	- you need to chekout the porject Docbook_projects/ant-docbook-styler from lievre
	- then from fr.irisa.triskell/kermeta.documentation/src run one of the Kermeta*_build.xml
		it will unzip and install the antdocbook styler files in your workspace. 
		On unix/linux systyem you may have path troubles if someone has commited u
		nnecessary files in the cvs (that twould have been regenerated by ant-docbook-style otherwise)
	- check the path in common_build.xml so the files will be copied to to web site. 
	(eventually copy them manually if you prefer)
	the webdeploy_build.xml should do all the work (generating all the documentation and deploying it)
- traceability
 chekout from lievre
 generate model, edit, editor (the traceability.genmodel should be ok)
 
- Kermeta

	1. you must change or check all the	version number in the plugin.xml, feature.xml and site.xml files
	 (including the documentation and the raceability)
	
	2. In the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta project update the file about.properties
    
    3. in fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.feature project, go to Content tab of feature.xml, and modify the content
      to get the last versions of the plugins linked to this feature 
    
	4. use the site.xml   pde/builder   to compile everything
	
	5. deploy it locally in your current configuration using a local site update (not the remote one !)
 	and test the version : 
 		- create a "update" directory somewhere, 
 		- copy, from fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.site project : plugins directory, features directory, and site.xml
 	
 	6. Special : it seems like you need to add the directory, in Build tab of your plugin,
 	in the "Binary Build" , that contains the icons that are used in the plugin, otherwise
 	in the deployed version it wont be added.
 	

 if ok 
	- check the new features, corrected bugs, improvement done in this version (ask every developers
	 and cross chek in the trackers
	 	eventually update the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.site/history.html file with all those changes
	 close the issues corresponding issues in the tracker
	 eventually check and update the tasks tracker too.

eventually backup the existing version

use the fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.site/copy_build.xml to deploy the plugin in the site update.
backup this new version on the web site


- tag the version
- generate a zip from the feature export, post it on the file section of the gforge 
	(do not forget the change history)
- send a mail on the kermeta-users list
- create a news on the forge
