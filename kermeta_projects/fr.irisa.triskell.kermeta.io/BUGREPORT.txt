Bug 1 : error when calling an operation coming from an extern package
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Resolved.
The problem was : detecting if a class belongs to the current package or not
(there was a test like "qname.startswith(root_package_name)" that were dangerous
if the name of the root_package and this qname real root_package were different
but had the same prefix... simply added "::" to the string inside startswith-test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug 2 : problem with annotations
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolved.
Problem : Conflicts were not correctly resolved by antlr. Added an abstract type
(AnnotableElement)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug 3 : problem with circular references
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unresolved.
KMT2KMPass : a test of the existence of a type which is dangerous : 
a type can already exists in the resource for the following reason : circular
references. (interdependant package requires)
