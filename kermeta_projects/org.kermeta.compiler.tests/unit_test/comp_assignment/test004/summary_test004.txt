Assignment of a feature has type of a feature from another ClassDefinition with further cases: different multiplicities.

Important note: the semantic of the assignment is delegated to EMF, i.e.: the assignment semantic is defined by the Java source code that EMF generate. It would be interesting to add a survey of the behaviour of EMF in order to track semantic evolution from EMF.
