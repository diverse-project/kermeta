Design:

If the left and right expressions have the same type and "attr" is a property from a Class Definition "myCD" and the multiplicity is [0..1] or [1..1]
In kmt: attr := theValueOfAttr
In Java: myCD.setAttr(theValueOfAttr);

If the left and right expressions have the same type and "attr" is a property from a Class Definition "myCD" and the multiplicity is [0..*] or [1..*]
In kmt: attr := theValueOfAttr
In Java: myCD.getAttr.add(theValueOfAttr);
