	Context},
  booktitle = {MoDELS'07},
  year = {2007},
  address = {Nashville, TN, USA},
  abstract = {As development techniques, paradigms and platforms evolve far more
	quickly than domain applications, software modernization and migration,
	is a constant challenge to software engineers. For more than ten
	years now, the Sodifrance company has been intensively using Model-Driven
	Engineering (MDE) for both development and migration projects. In
	this paper we report on the use of MDE as an efficient, flexible
	and reliable approach for a migration process (reverse-engineering,
	transformation and code generation). Moreover, we discuss how MDE
	is economically
	
	profitable and is cost-effective over the migration through out-sourced
	manual re-development. The paper is illustrated with the migration
	of a large-scale banking system from Mainframe to J2EE.},

  booktitle = {TOOLS EUROPE workshop on TOWERS},
  year = {2007},
  address = {Zurich, Switzerland},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {Domain-Specific Language (DSL) are getting more and more popular and
	are being used in critical systems like aerospace and car industries.
	Methods for simulating and validating DSL models are now necessary
	in order to make the new software generation more reliable and less
	costly.
	
	Developing analysis tools for DSL requires the definition of models
	semantics. In this paper, we propose a framework to give a formal
	foundation of the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. We separate
	the usually common notions of models and modelling languages associating
	to each of them a different goal. In order to prove the consistency
	of our proposal we express a subset of EMOF, its static semantics
	and validate its meta-circularity.},

	applied for model validation in the past. In our current work, we
	are enriching the USE specification language with imperative elements.
	We employ this extension as an assembler to realize UML model (class
	diagram) transformations with USE in a flexible way: UML transformations
	are described using a custom abstract language based on object diagram-like
	patterns. These descriptions are automatically translated into the
	imperative USE extensions. Our approach aims to provide a flexible
	instrument to experiment with different transformations and transformation
	formalisms.},
