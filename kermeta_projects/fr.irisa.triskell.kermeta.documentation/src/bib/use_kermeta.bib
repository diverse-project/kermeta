  booktitle = {EDOC'07 (Entreprise Distributed Object Computing Conference)},
  year = {2007},
  address = {Annapolis, MD, USA},
  abstract = {Requirements documentation is a collection of partial specifications
	produced by different stakeholders. Obtaining a global specification
	is a fundamental step of a requirement analysis process. Merging
	requirement specifications is indeed a way to reveal inconsistencies
	between them. We propose in this paper a model-driven mechanism for
	
	that purpose. It takes as inputs a set of texts or models which conform
	to input requirement languages and produces a global requirements
	model. This mechanism is integrated in a platform called R2A which
	stands for “requirements to analysis”. The R2A core element is its
	core requirement metamodel which has been defined for capturing the
	global requirements model. We illustrate our approach with requirement
	specifications expressed in a constrained natural language. This
	platform and its mechanism have been completely implemented with
	MDE (Model Driven Engineering) technologies. As such, it is a good
	example of how MDE technologies can contribute to requirements engineering
	as a technical solution.},

  journal = {Journal of Software and Systems Modeling ({SoSyM})},

  abstract = {Model transformation is a core mechanism for model-driven engineering

	efficient testing techniques are required as for any complex program
	development. Testing a model transformation is typically performed
	by checking the results of the transformation applied to a set of

	it is difficult to qualify the relevance of these models for testing.
	In this paper, we propose a set of rules and a framework to assess
	the quality of given input models for testing a given transformation.
	Furthermore, the framework identifies missing model elements in input
	models and assists the user in improving these models.},

  year = {2007},
  volume = {LNCS 4620},
  pages = {167-199},
  eid = {Springer-Verlag},
  abstract = {Handling aspects within models looks promising for managing crosscutting
	concerns early in the software life-cycle, up from programming to
	design, analysis and even requirements. At the modeling level, even
	complex behavioral aspects can easily be described for instance as
	pairs of sequence diagrams: one for the pointcut specifying the behavior
	to detect, and the second one for an advice representing the wanted
	behavior at the join point. While this is fine for informal documentation
	purposes, or even intuitive enough when a single aspect has to be
	woven, a more precise semantics of both join point detection and
	advice weaving is needed for using these modeling artifacts for Model
	Driven Engineering activities such as code generation or test synthesis.
	This paper proposes various interpretations for pointcuts that allow
	multiple behavioral aspects to be statically woven. The idea is to
	allow join points to match a pointcut even when some extra-messages
	occur in between. However, with this new way of specifying join points,
	the composition of the advice with the detected part cannot any longer
	be just a replacement of the detected part by the advice. We have
	to consider the events (or the messages) of the join point, but also
	the events which occur between them, and merge them with the behavior
	specified within the advice. We thus also propose a formal definition
	of a new merge operator, and describe its implementation on the Kermeta
	platform.},

  month = jul,
  abstract = {In MDE, model transformations should be efficiently tested so that
	it may be used and reused safely. Mutation analysis is an efficient
	technique to evaluate the quality of test data, and has been extensively
	studied both for procedural and object-oriented languages. In this
	paper, we study how it can be adapted to model oriented programming.
	Since no model transformation language has been widely accepted today,
	we propose generic fault models that are related to the model transformation
	process. First, we identify abstract operations that constitute this
	process: model navigation, model’s elements filtering, output model
	creation and input model modification. Then, we propose a set of
	specific mutation operators which are directly inspired from these
	operations. We believe that these operators are meaningful since
	a large part of the errors in a transformation are due to the manipulation
	of complex models regardless of the concrete implementation language.},

	for the interpretation of the metamodel semantics. The interest of

	to reify the various semantic variation points of UML 2.0 statecharts
	into models of their own to avoid hardcoding the semantic choices
	in the tools. We do the same for various implementation choices.
	Then, along the line of the OMG's Model Driven Architecture, these
	semantic and implementation models are processed along with a source
	UML model (that can be seen as a PIM) to provide a target UML model
	(a PSM) where all semantic and implementation choice are made explicit.
	This target model can in turn serve as a basis for a consistent use
	of code generation, simulation, model-checking or test generation
