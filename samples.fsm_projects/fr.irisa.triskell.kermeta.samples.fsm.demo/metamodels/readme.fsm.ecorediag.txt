FSM demo

The file named "fsm.ecorediag" is the graphical view of the deployed FSM metamodel (generated EMF API dedicated to FSM in the "plugin" folder).
We use the nsuri of the FSM package (http://kermeta/samples/fsm.ecore) instead of the ecore file.
Thus, the FSM structure cannot be modified through these files.
You can get the FSM metamodel as file (*.ecore) in the plugin: fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.samples.fsm/src/metamodels/fsm.ecore
