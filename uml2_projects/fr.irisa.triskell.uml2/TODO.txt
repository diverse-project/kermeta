Bugs :
- uml2km fails to save ".km" files
- 

From UML 2.0 to 2.1 :
====================
The UMLAUT 2006 has been designed for the 2.0 version of UML.
As Kermeta switched to Eclipse 3.2 and TopCased switch to new XMI and UML 2.1,
we need to embed this versions into UMLAUT

 1 - produce the Uml2.1.kmt file :
	- take the new UML.ecore file (in the good XMI version)
	- apply to it the TopDownVisitor from 
		fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.ecore/src/kermeta/transformations
		(in the "ecore_projects" of the Kermeta gForge)
	- transform the modified UML.ecore into "kmt"
	- extract from it the TopDownVisitor part in the "TopDownVisitor.kmt" file

 2 - search for the UML elements attributes which name has changed between the
two versions

 3 - make the (we hope few) changes inside the code :
		some attributes names have changed, like :
			Model.ownedMember -> Model.ownedPackage

 4 - run all unit tests

Other :
======
 1 - write unit tests for the uml2km tool
 2 - write unit tests for the valooder transformation
