Description :
-------------
This directory contains the models of the "three-way switch"
sample for the UML2 Kermeta project.

Models that rely on this project:
--------------------------------

0) uml2 model :
 Designed with TopCased and Eclipse, it contains all the
 diagrams of the sample, in an UML2 form.
 This model is the one to be processed with UMLAUT.
 
 As TopCased can only draft pure Class diagrams and
 pure UseCases diagrams, the states charts and the instances
 diagrams have been included in the model by hand, in
 Eclipse IDE.
 
1) xmi model :
 This model is an draft of the states charts and instances
 diagrams, for illustration purposes, designed within Poseidon
 UML2 tool.
