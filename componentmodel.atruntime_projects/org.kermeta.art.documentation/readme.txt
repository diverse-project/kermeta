the toc.xml is both deployed in the kermeta MDK documentation 
and via the anchor into the DiVA studio Guide

this allows to have both a unified DiVA studio view 
and a standalone view if this component is distributed outside of the Studio  

The idea is to provide everything in this toc.xml in order to be able to display it in both 
places, however, other toc organization are possible if the principle to display it in both places
is maintained
